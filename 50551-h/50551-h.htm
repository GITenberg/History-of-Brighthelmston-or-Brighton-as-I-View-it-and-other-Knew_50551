v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The publication of the History of Brighton had proceeded, with
the most gratifying success, through ten monthly numbers, when it
was suddenly interrupted by the lamented decease of the
Author&mdash;Mr. J. A. Erredge.&nbsp; Death came upon him, not
stealthily, but in its most awful form.&nbsp; It surprised him
literally at the desk.&nbsp; Whilst talking cheerfully to the
publisher, the hand of Death was laid upon him, and he fell dead
to the ground;&mdash;the ink of these pages was still wet whilst
the Author was extended on the floor a corpse.&nbsp; So terrible
an occurrence for a brief space delayed the publication of the
work, but fortunately for the family of the author, the MS. was
nearly completed, and his sons were enabled, from the materials
left by their lamented father, to compile the few last pages and
send the two concluding numbers through the press.&nbsp; The
History of Brighton is now completed, and whatever shortcomings
may be detected in the two concluding numbers, which had not the
advantage of being corrected by the Author, will no doubt be
pardoned by a generous public.</p>

THE ROMANS AT BRIGHTON.</h2>
<p>Although there is no doubt that the vicinity of Brighton at a
very remote period was occupied as a Roman military station, it
is not the intention of the compiler of this work to date, merely
on supposition, the origin of the town, coeval as it might have
been with the landing of Julius C&aelig;sar in Britain.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Magna Britannia,&rdquo; published in 1737,
mentions:&mdash;&ldquo;As to the antiquity of this town, there is
reason to believe it to have stood a vast tract of time.&nbsp;
From the accounts our historians give of it, for some of them
speak of it ever since Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s arrival in
Britain, and affirm, that this was the place where he landed his
legions; (August 26th, 55 B.C., <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a>) but since others
assert his landing to have been at Hastings, we shall not be very
positive, yet may justly insist upon it as most probable, because
there is good anchorage in the bay here; and besides, there
appears on the west side of this town to this day, for near a
mile together, vast numbers of men&rsquo;s bones, and some of
them of prodigious size, which plainly proves that there has been
some warlike engagement near it.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an illustration
that what has been transmitted to us orally, especially of remote
periods, cannot be relied on, there is told the following tale of
&ldquo;C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Stile&rdquo;:&mdash;Dr. Stukely, or
some other antiquarian, was travelling through England, when he
heard that on a certain hill there was a stile called
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Stile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the
doctor, &ldquo;such a road, mentioned in Antoninus, passed near
here; and the traditional name confirms the possibility of a
Roman camp on this <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst he was surveying the prospect,
a peasant came up, whom the doctor addressed
thus&mdash;&ldquo;They call this C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Stile, my
friend, do they not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ees, zur,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;they calls it so arter poor old Bob C&aelig;sar,
the carpenter; rest his soul; I holped him to make it, when I was
a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Burrell MSS.&rdquo; state that:&mdash;&ldquo;There
are three Roman castra, or camps, lying in a line over-thwart the
Downs from Brighthelmstone to Ditchelling, from south to
north.&nbsp; The first, a large one, called the Castle, about a
mile from Brighton, eastward, and a mile from the sea, on the
summit of a lofty hill commanding the sea-coast; the next, a
smaller, called Hollingbury Castle, nearly about the middle of
the Downs, also commanding from a lofty hill, by Stanmer, the
whole western sea-coast of Sussex; and a third, a large one,
called Ditchelling Castle, containing between twelve and fourteen
acres, is the highest point of the Downs thereabouts, and
commands part of the sea-coast, and all the northern edge of the
Downs, and the wild underneath it.&rdquo;&nbsp; A military Roman
way was discovered a few years ago, on St. John&rsquo;s Common,
and in the enclosed lands adjoining, in the parishes of Keymer
and Clayton, fully confirming the opinion of Camden and
Stillingfleet that the <i>Portus Adurni</i> of the Romans was at
Aldrington. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; On the west side also of Glynd
Bridge, near Lewes, a paved Roman causeway was discovered, lying
three feet beneath the turf, upon a bed of silt, or blue clay,
twenty feet thick; and near it was found a large brass coin of
Antoninus Pius.</p>
<p>By whatever name Brighton was then known, there is no doubt it
was a place of some note in the time of the Romans, as it was
peculiarly favourable to all the purposes of the fisher and the
hunter.&nbsp; Romish coins are still frequently found in its
vicinity, and in the year 1750, near the town, an urn was dug up,
which contained a thousand <i>denarii</i> of different impresses
from Antoninus Pius to the Emperor Philip; and since that time
there have been <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>found in some of the burghs or barrows to the east of the
town, ashes and fragments of human bones, enclosed in urns of
Roman manufacture.&nbsp; In preparing the ground for enclosing of
the Old Stein, in 1818, several Roman coins were turned up by the
workmen, on one of which, round the impression of the head, was
the inscription, &ldquo;IMP. ALEXANDER PIUS, A. V. C,&rdquo; and
on the reverse, &ldquo;MARS ULTOR,&rdquo; with the initials S. C.
between the figure of Mars.&nbsp; The date, however, was
illegible.&nbsp; In forming the Race Course to the south of the
Stand,&mdash;since restored to its original state,&mdash;several
urns of Roman fabrication were dug up; and since then, to the
east of the town, ashes and fragments of human bones have been
found enclosed in Roman urns.</p>
<p>Relicts of the ancient Britons, before the time of the Romans
in Britain, have at various times been found in the vicinity of
Brighton.&nbsp; The most perfect were those discovered in a
Barrow in Coney-burrow field, Hove, in January, 1856.&nbsp; In
this field was a mound about 20 feet high, situated north of the
pathway from Brighton to Hove, about N.N.E. of the church of St.
John the Baptist.&nbsp; Some 40 years since, this hillock was
covered with furze, and was a burrow for rabbits; but at a more
recent date, when the habitations of men became erected
contiguous, and the human family extended thither, the colony of
rabbits dispersed, and their abode became the rendezvous of
rustic games.&nbsp; Our highly respected local antiquarian,
Barclay Phillips, Esq., thus describes it, and the incidents
connected with it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rising from a perfectly level plain, and
being unconnected with any other hills, it always presented the
appearance of an artificial mound, and therefore, when, some
years ago, a road was cut through it to the Hove Station of the
Brighton and Portsmouth Railway, I was anxious to learn whether
any antiquities had been met with; but not any were then
found.&nbsp; Now, however, all doubt on the subject has been set
at rest, and the hillock proved to be a Barrow, or monumental
mound erected over the remains of an ancient British
chieftain.&nbsp; Labourers have recently been employed removing
the earth of this hill, and last week, on reaching the centre of
the mound, about two yards west of the road leading to Hove
Station, and about nine feet below the surface, dug out a rude
coffin between six and seven feet long.&nbsp; On exposure to the
atmosphere the boards immediately crumbled away; but a few of the
knots remained, and prove to be of oak.&nbsp; The coffin
contained small fragments of bone, some of which I have seen, and
the following curious relics:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; An Amber Cup, with a handle on one side.&nbsp;
It is hemispherical in shape, <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>rather deep, with a lip turning
outwards, and is ornamented merely with a band of fine lines
running round the outside about half an inch from the top.&nbsp;
From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band
before-mentioned not passing over the space within the handle,
and its being marked off at each end with a line seemingly cut
across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Head of a Battle Axe, about five inches
long.&nbsp; It is in perfect preservation, and made of some sort
of iron-stone, the wooden handle, having of course, long since
decayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; A small Whetstone, with a hole neatly drilled
through one end, so that it might be suspended by a thong to the
person, and carried about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; A Bronze Spear Head, very much oxidised, and
so brittle that it broke into halves as it was being taken out of
the ground.&nbsp; Two of the rivets and fragments of the spear
handle still remain attached to the lower end of the blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The workmen described the coffin as resting on the
natural soil, which is stiff yellow clay, while the mound itself
bears every appearance of having been formed of surface earth and
rubbish thrown up together.&nbsp; I minutely examined the
sections of the hill, and myself picked out several specimens of
charred wood, and was informed that such fragments were very
abundant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manner of sepulture and all the relics, excepting
the spear head, indicate this mound as having been the
burial-place of a British chieftain before the time of the Roman
invasion;&mdash;the spear-head certainly more nearly, though not
exactly, resembles those used afterwards.&nbsp; The mound was of
the simplest and most ancient form, and therefore I am inclined
to think we may reckon it as at least 2000 years old, perhaps
more!&nbsp; It has now disappeared.&nbsp; The last clod of that
earth which so long covered the bones of a British chieftain was
this afternoon carted away; and coffin, bones, and earth have
been thrown pell-mell to form the mould of the future rosary of
Palmyra square.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a meeting of the Arch&aelig;ological Society in London,
about a month after the opening of this barrow, the cup, &amp;c.,
were exhibited; when Mr. Kemble and other celebrated antiquaries
gave their opinion thus:&mdash;&ldquo;The cup is the only known
specimen of so large a size, and the battle axe is superior to
any similar object in the British Museum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Hawkins and Mr. Franks, who have the care of the antiquarian
departments, both declared the &ldquo;find&rdquo; in this barrow
to have been the richest ever known.&nbsp; These rare specimens
of local antiquity, through the kindness of Sir Francis Goldsmid,
of &ldquo;The Wick,&rdquo; on whose land they were found, form a
prominent feature of the Brighton Museum, at the Royal
Pavilion.</p>

SITUATION, SOIL, GEOLOGY, AND CLIMATE OF BRIGHTON.</h2>
<p>Brighton is situated in 50&deg;.55&prime;. N. latitude, and
about 3&prime;. W. longitude, on the eastern side of a shallow
bay of the south coast.&nbsp; The centre of the town is in a
valley, which at the north diverges to Preston in two courses
prominently marked by the London road and the Lewes road,
Hollingbury Hill intervening.&nbsp; The east and north-west
portions of the town are on acclivities, that to the east
terminating abruptly at the south in cliffs ranging from 60 to 80
feet in height; and that to the north-west gradually sloping to
the sea-shore.&nbsp; The southern front is bold, and commands an
extensive view of the British Channel from Beachy Head to Selsea
Bill.</p>
<p>The soil to the east and north-west is principally a thick
substratum of chalk, covered with a thin layer of earth.&nbsp;
The subsoil of the centre is marl and shingle; and to the
westward there are large beds of clay of very irregular
character.&nbsp; Dr. Mantell, in his valuable work, &ldquo;The
Geology of the South-east of England,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The town of Brighton is situated on an immense
accumulation of water-worn materials, which fills up a valley, or
hollow, in the chalk.&nbsp; The diluvial deposit is bounded on
the north-west by the South Downs; on the east it extends to
Rottingdean, and is there terminated by the chalk; on the west it
may be traced more or less distinctly to Bignor; on the south it
is washed by the sea, and forms a line of cliffs from 70 to 80
feet high; these exhibit a vertical section of the strata, and
enable us to ascertain their nature and position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soil of the Downs,&rdquo; says Young in his
Agricultural Survey of Sussex, &ldquo;is subject to considerable
variation.&nbsp; On the summit it is usually very shallow, the
substratum is chalk, and over that a layer of chalk rubble, and
partially rolled chalk flints, with a slight covering of
vegetable mould.&nbsp; Along the more elevated ridges there is
sometimes merely a covering of flints, upon which the turf grows
spontaneously.&nbsp; Advancing down the hills, the soil becomes
deeper, and at the bottom is constantly found to be of very <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>sufficient
depth for ploughing: here the loam is excellent, generally ten or
twelve inches thick, and the chalk rather broken, and mixed with
loam in the interstices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coombe rock,&mdash;a provincial term,&mdash;which greatly
abounds in and about the eastern part of the town, is
geologically known as the Elephant bed; and, according to the
same authority, &ldquo;is composed of broken chalk, with angular
fragments of flint, imbedded in a calcareous mass of a yellowish
colour, constituting a very hard and coarse conglomerate.&nbsp;
It is not stratified, but is merely a confused heap of alluvial
materials; where it forms a junction with the shingle bed, a
layer of broken shells generally occurs: they are too fragile to
extract whole: they appear to belong to the genera modiola,
mytilus, nerita, &amp;c.&nbsp; It varies considerably in its
appearance and composition, in different parts of its
course.&nbsp; In the inferior portion of the mass, the chalk is
reduced to very small pieces, which gradually become larger in
proportion to their height in the cliff: at length fragments of
flint appear; and these increase in size and number as they
approach the upper part of the bed, of which they constitute the
most considerable portion.&nbsp; These flints are more or less
broken, and resemble those of our ploughed lands that have been
long exposed to the action of the atmosphere.&nbsp; In some parts
of the cliff, irregular masses occur of an extraordinary
hardness; these have been produced by an infiltration of
crystallised carbonate of lime.&nbsp; Large blocks of this
variety may be seen on the shore, opposite to the New Steine,
where they have for years resisted the action of the waves.&nbsp;
This bed also contains water-worn blocks of siliceous sandstone,
and ferruginous breccia.&nbsp; Small nodular masses, composed of
carbonate of iron in lenticular crystals, interspersed with brown
calcareous spar, have occasionally been found at the depth of ten
or twelve feet from the summit of the cliff.&nbsp; The organic
remains discovered in this deposit are the bones and teeth of the
ox, deer, horse, and of the Asiatic elephant; <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> these occur but seldom, and are
generally <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>more or less waterworn; <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a> but, in some
instances, they are quite entire, and cannot have been subject to
the action of the waves.&nbsp; The wells in the less elevated
parts of the town pass through the calcareous bed, shingle, and
sand, in succession; upon reaching the chalk, springs of good
water burst forth, and these are said to be influenced by the
tides.&rdquo; <a name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a></p>
<p>The sinking of the Warren Farm Well, at the Industrial
Schools, has formed a very interesting subject to geologists, and
on the 5th of November, 1861, the Surveyor, Mr. George Maynard,
made a report to the Directors and Guardians, as to the state of
the well, wherein he &ldquo;wished it to be understood that he
was neither a professor of geology nor an hydraulic
engineer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It stated that the work was commenced on
the 22nd March, 1858, and had been continued since without
intermission:&mdash;&ldquo;In sinking the well (says Mr.
Maynard), I have found that the different strata perforated have
been thicker than is generally set forth by professors of, or
writers upon geology, proving that the dip of the strata is
greater at this particular spot than is commonly found elsewhere,
especially the gault, which is now being perforated.&nbsp; I have
ascertained that the shanklin, or lower green sand, forming the
bottom portion of the glaucomic strata, appear on the surface at
Henfield, and continue near the base of the Downs as far as
Albourne, thus proving, from the depth attained, that a
considerable vale is formed in the strata between Henfield and
Beachy Head.&nbsp; The well at the Industrial Schools lies nearly
in a direct line, and not far from the centre in distance,
between Henfield and the point at Beachy Head, at the base of
which water is continually flowing between the malm and gault
strata.&nbsp; Hence arises the fact of the gault stratum being so
much thicker than was contemplated; but if the shanklin, or lower
green sand is reached and penetrated, there <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>is little doubt
an ample and continuous supply of water will be obtained, which
in all probability will run up to the level of the land at
Henfield (from whence the supply will originate), or above the
bottom pump in the well.&nbsp; I have tested the quality of the
stratum now being penetrated, and feel persuaded that if water is
obtained it will be of a good quality.&nbsp; I have already
reported my interview with Sir Roderick Murchison and other
professors of geology, at the Institute of Practical Geology, in
Jermyn Street, London, at which meeting I was encouraged to hope
that water would be obtained at a depth not far distant from that
which the well has already been sunk; they, at the same time,
expressing their surprise that the shanklin sand had not been
reached before, and also kindly giving me valuable information
how to proceed when that stratum was penetrated.&nbsp; The
stratum in which the men are at work at this present time is very
soft, so much so that if boring was determined on, it would be
requisite to insert iron pipes, which, in my opinion, would be
more expensive than the present mode of digging and
steining.&nbsp; The depth of the well now attained is 1,080
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few organic remains have been found near Brighton.&nbsp; Dr.
Mantell mentions but a fragment of a bone resembling the femur,
and a grinder of a large size, decidedly the latter that of an
Asiatic elephant, in the brick-loam at Hove; the jaw of a whale
in the shingle bed; the antlers and bones of the red deer in a
bed of loam, in sinking a well near the cavalry barracks; the
remains of a deer in the diluvium at Copperas Gap, by the Rev. H.
Hoper; and similar remains in digging a well near the Western
Road.</p>
<p>With respect to climate, medical men, who have made it their
study, have divided the town into three districts.&nbsp; In 1845,
Dr. Wigan, then in medical practice in the town, published an
elaborate treatise, &ldquo;Brighton and its Three
Climates,&rdquo; and in 1859, Dr. Kebbell, Physician to the
Sussex County Hospital, produced his valuable book, &ldquo;The
Climate of Brighton.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former considers the
north-west part of the town the most salubrious, as it is exempt
from the keen easterly winds, and is generally free from the fogs
and smoke of the central district.&nbsp; It is free, too, of the
marine exhalations to which that district is subject.&nbsp; The
air of the east <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>division is bracing, and likewise exempt from the saline
particles which impregnate the atmosphere of the lower part of
the town, a district which differs but little from any inland
town in a low situation, and possesses none of the quality called
bracing.&nbsp; Fogs, night and morning, frequently hang about the
middle district, which may be termed the business quarter of the
town.</p>
<p>Dr. Kebbell says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brighton, in respect of temperature and the
sensation of cold, offers great variety of climate according as
the situations are more or less elevated, sheltered, or
exposed.&nbsp; The observations of myself and others go to prove,
that the elevated portions of the Montpelier districts, in the
neighbourhood of All Saints&rsquo; Church, are decidedly the
coldest, being exposed to the full effects of the strong currents
of air from the Downs.&nbsp; After this come the north-eastern
districts, including the upper part of the Marine Parade, Kemp
Town, and the portions of the town behind them on the north side
of the Bristol Road, which are also very much exposed to the cold
winds and draughts from the downs.&nbsp; The central parts of the
town, from the Old Steine to St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, are the
most sheltered from the winds; both by the downs behind, which
protect them from the north-east winds; and by the buildings in
front which break the force of the south-west winds; but being on
a level surface and enclosed between hills, it is damper than any
other part of the town; and I have noticed that in the autumn and
winter, the night mists return earlier in the afternoon, and are
dispersed later in the morning, than is the case in the more
elevated and exposed districts.&nbsp; The low level or valley of
the King&rsquo;s Road, though exposed to the full force of the
south-west-winds, is still more sheltered from the cold
north-east winds by the great mass of buildings and the hills
behind, and is decidedly the warmest and mildest part of the
town, offering a very marked contrast to the cold elevated part
of the Montpelier district.&nbsp; Sir James Clark speaks of the
West cliff as being &lsquo;somewhat damp,&rsquo; <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> but I am at a loss to conceive how this
can be so, taking into consideration its sloping surface, the
general porous character of the soil, together with its direct
exposure to the <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>rays of the sun.&nbsp; In point of warmth, the first
half or third of the Marine Parade ranks next to the valley of
the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; Further east, towards Kemp Town, the
air becomes colder and more bracing, and the draughts from the
downs are more keenly felt.&nbsp; The parts of the town between
the Western Road, and the line of Upper North Street and
Montpelier Terrace, occupy, in point of climate, an intermediate
position between the valley of the King&rsquo;s Road, and the
cold and exposed portion of the Montpelier district.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>I cannot conceive any place enjoying greater natural
advantages than Brighton, and it is incumbent on those who think
it unhealthy to state from what source the insalubrity can have
its origin, always excepting those artificial and preventable
causes of disease which it creates within itself.&nbsp; For
upwards of half the year the inhabitants breathe an atmosphere
which has traversed the surface of several thousand miles of the
great Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; This at all events must be entirely
free from all sources of disease.&nbsp; The staple of the land
upon which the town stands, and for several miles round, is
composed of chalk and sand, intermixed with flints, with the dip
of the strata towards the sea, which, with the absence of any
dense foliage in the surrounding district, has the effect of
rendering the atmosphere of the place remarkably dry and
bracing.&nbsp; Neither is there any low-lying marsh land, where
the fresh and sea water mix and infect the atmosphere, or
exposure of mud at the mouths of rivers at low tide, or, in fact,
any source of malaria whatever within any distance of the town,
which can possibly to any appreciable or injurious extent affect
its atmosphere.&nbsp; The winds from the land side, therefore,
are probably almost, if not entirely, as healthy as those from
the sea.&nbsp; Brighton has also no tidal harbour, nor any
exposure of mud at low tide containing decaying vegetable matter,
which at many sea-side places, and some much frequented by the
public, is not only very offensive, but very injurious to the
health.&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"

class="smcap">Chapter</span> III.<br />
THE ETYMOLOGY AND EARLY HISTORY OF BRIGHTON.</h2>
<p>The obscurity respecting the etymology of Brighton, or more
properly speaking Brighthelmston, is much to be regretted.&nbsp;
In the Domesday Book it is written <i>Brighthelmstun</i>,
evidently derived from <i>Brighthelm</i>, the name of some person
of eminence, to whom it belonged, and <i>tun</i> the Saxon of
town or dwelling.&nbsp; Bailey says that the name was given to
the town by <i>St. Brighthelm</i>, a Saxon.&nbsp; Skinner says
the town was so named from <i>Brighthelm</i>, a canonised bishop
of Fontenoy, who lived about the middle of the 10th
century.&nbsp; Stillingfleet and other authorities state that a
Saxon bishop of that name resided here during the Heptarchy, and
his name was given to the town.&nbsp; The last opinion is most to
be relied on, as, when Ella and his three sons&mdash;Cimen,
Wiencing, and Cisa,&mdash;landed in Sussex, at Shoreham, in 447,
Bishop <i>Brighthelm</i> accompanied them; and one of his
successors resided at Aldrington, the <i>Portus Adurni</i>, or
port of the river Adur, (where, near Fishersgate, till within the
last forty years, was the entrance to the harbour from the sea),
<a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> and held a considerable portion of the
land thereabout until 693, when he was killed in battle; but
where the battle was fought no mention is made.</p>
<p>Dr. Relhan says:&mdash;&ldquo;The light sometimes obtained in
these dark matters from a similitude of sounds in the ancient and
modern names of places, is not to be had in assisting the present
conjecture.&nbsp; Its ancient one, as far as I can learn, is no
way discoverable: and its modern one may be owing either to this
town&rsquo;s belonging formerly to, or being countenanced in a
particular manner, by a Bishop Brighthelm, who during the former
government of the island, lived in this neighbourhood: or perhaps
may be deduced from the ships of this town having their helms
better ornamented than those of their neighbouring
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The
earliest record of the modern name, Brighton, is to be found in
the Burrell MSS.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;17.&nbsp; Henry IV.&nbsp; Thomas Seynt
Clare holds the manor of Brighton with lands and messuages in the
same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is quoted from the same authority&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Mary.&nbsp; The queen on the 27th
day of Nov. let to farm to William May, valet of the kitchen, the
manor of Brightelston with all its appurtenances for 21 years,
from the feast of St. Mich&aelig;l last past, for the annual rent
of 6<i>l</i> 13<i>s</i> 4<i>d.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. James Charles Michell, who re-published Dr. Relhan&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Short History of Brighthelmston, in 1761,&rdquo; mentions
it to be met with in the terrier to the tenantry land, dated
1660.</p>
<p>Domesday book states that two of the three manors of
Brighthelmston had been held by Edward the Confessor; but it has
been aptly observed, that, notwithstanding, they might not have
belonged to that prince; for the Normans, who denounced Harold
the Second as an usurper, invariably substituted the name of
Edward, when jurors were empannelled, in order to make an
accurate return of the several manors within their respective
hundreds, putting down that of Harold, as the statutes of the
republican parliament of the 17th century are all references to
Charles II.&nbsp; It is therefore fair to presume that the whole,
or most of the town and parish belonged to the ancestors of Earl
Godwin many generations prior to the Conquest, if not ever since
the establishment of the Saxon power in this part of the
island.&nbsp; They were styled <i>Thanes</i>, or noblemen of
considerable possessions.</p>
<p>The only <i>Thane</i> whose name, qualities, and achievements
have been made known to us, was Ulnoth or Wolnoth, the father of
Earl Godwin and lord of the manor of Brighthelmston.&nbsp; This
nobleman was appointed by Ethelred II. to direct the equipment
of, and afterwards to command, the ships sent by the county of
Sussex in 1008, as its quota towards the national fleet which the
king was then collecting to oppose the Danes, who were come a
second time to levy contributions on England.&nbsp; Godwin, his
son and successor to the manor, was banished by order of Edward,
who took it with other possessions.&nbsp; He regained them by
force, and retained them till 17th of April, 1053, when he was
suddenly <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>taken ill while dining at Winchester, where the court of
Edward was then held, and died four days afterwards.</p>
<p>Earl Godwin was succeeded in two of the chief manors by his
son Harold, who, upon the death of Edward, in 1065, was chosen
king: but, from some secret arrangements between the king and
William, duke of Normandy, the latter made a claim which he
asserted by force of arms.&nbsp; He landed at Pevensey.&nbsp;
Harold at the time was at Stanford Bridge, near York, where he
had defeated Toston, his unnatural brother, and Harold Harfager,
the king of Norway; and hearing of William&rsquo;s arrival, he
immediately proceeded southward, and with the addition of some
levies hastily collected at Brighthelmston and his other manors
in Sussex, encamped within nine miles of the invader.&nbsp; On
the 14th of October, 1066, he joined battle with the Normans, and
after performing all that valour and judgment could do against a
brave enemy, he closed his life in the field of battle, near
Hastings, having been pierced in the brain with an arrow.</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s possessions at Brighthelmston having fallen
into the hands of William the Conqueror, the town was conferred
on his son-in-law, one of his generals, William, Lord de Warren,
in Normandy, who was created Earl of Surrey.</p>
<p>In 1081, when the survey of Sussex was made by commissioners
under order from William the Conqueror, the manor of
Brighton&mdash;Brighthelmston-Michelham,&mdash;had attached to it
four <i>hag&aelig;</i>, or tenements, in the town of Lewes, for
which a sum of twelve pounds a-year was paid.&nbsp; These
<i>hag&aelig;</i> were places of resort for protection in seasons
of danger from feuds between neighbouring heptarchs, or from the
ravages of the Danes, Lewes being the fortified borough under the
lord of the barony, then William de Warren.&nbsp; The manor of
Brighthelmston-Michelham was held of the king by three Aloarii,
or joint tenants of the same manor, who owed no suit or service
to any superior, but &ldquo;might go where they pleased,&rdquo;
that is, in the feudal language of Domesday, were attached to no
lord in a <i>seignoral</i>, but to the king alone in a civil
capacity.&nbsp; This manor defended itself for six hides, and one
yardland.&nbsp; One of the tenants had an <i>aula</i>, or
manor-house on his part.&nbsp; The shares of the two others were
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>used by
<i>villeins</i>, or slaves.&nbsp; The whole formed but one manor,
and contained five ploughlands of arable.&nbsp; After the
conquest, this manor was held by one Widard, under William de
Warren.&nbsp; He had one ploughland and a half in his demesne, or
immediate possession; and fourteen <i>villeins</i>, and
twenty-one <i>bordars</i>, or <i>bordarii</i>, occupiers of
cottages, used the three other ploughlands and a half.&nbsp; It
also contained seven acres of meadow, and wood enough to afford
<i>pannage</i>, or mast and acorns for twenty-one hogs belonging
to the <i>villeins</i> of the manor, three of which the lord was,
by the general custom of the county, entitled to.&nbsp; Lady
Amhurst is the present lady of this manor.</p>
<p>The manor of Brighthelmston-Lewes was held after the Conquest,
by Radulphus, a Norman adventurer, under William de Warren, and
defended itself for five hides and a half of land.&nbsp;
Radulphus held in demesne half a carucate, or ploughland, the
whole arable land of the manor being three carucates.&nbsp;
Eighteen <i>villeins</i> and nine bordars used the rest of the
arable land, for the cultivation of which, and the lord&rsquo;s
half carucate, they had three ploughs, and one <i>servus</i>, or
<i>villein en gross</i>, under them.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;gablum,&rdquo; or customary rent of this maritime manor,
was four thousand herrings or mackerel.&nbsp; To this day, if
demanded, the fishermen of Brighton pay to this manor six
mackerel for each boat, every time they return from mackerel
fishing.&nbsp; The fish thus paid is called &ldquo;Reve,&rdquo;
or more properly &ldquo;Reves,&rdquo; which signifies rent or
tithes, from the Saxon verb, <i>resian</i>, to exact.&nbsp; When
the Reve Inn, Upper Edward Street, was first opened, the sign
represented the lord&rsquo;s reve on horseback,
Murrell,&mdash;who at that time held the New England farm, the
site of the present railway works and land
contiguous,&mdash;receiving of a Brighton fisherman six
mackerel.&nbsp; In 1081 the manor was worth &pound;12 a
year.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Scrase Dickens and Mr. Thomas Wisden are
the present lords of this manor.</p>
<p>The manor of Atlingworth was held after the Conquest, by
William de Watteville, under William de Warren.&nbsp; He used one
ploughland in demesne, and thirteen <i>villeins</i> and eleven
<i>bordars</i> used the other.&nbsp; The church stood in this
manor, which was, at the grand survey, valued at &pound;12 a
year.&nbsp; In the reign of Stephen, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Ralph de Cheney was in possession of
this manor, and he gave the Priory at Lewes the advowson of the
church, together with all his lands in the parish; and in process
of time the whole manor became the property of the Priory.&nbsp;
Mr. Somers Clarke is the present lord, and Mrs. Penelope
McWhinnie is the present lady of this manor.&nbsp; By a decree of
the High Court of Chancery, made on the 21st day of October,
1760, a partition of this manor of Brighthelmston was made
between Thomas Friend and Bodycombe Sparrow, the then proprietors
of it, and the present lords accordingly possess the soil of it
in distinct moieties.&nbsp; In 1771, October 7th, Charles Scrase
bought (Henry) Sparrow&rsquo;s moiety.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Atlingworth, Adelingworth, Ablingworth,
Athelingworth, or Addlingworth (Tower Records, No. 50,) manor
lies in the parishes of Brighthelmston and Lewes; it is the
paramount manor, and extends over the Hoddown (Lord
Pelham&rsquo;s estate), formerly a
Warren.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Burrell MSS.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the three principal manors, there are within the town
and parish two other small manors, viz., Peakes and Harecourt; as
also parcels or members of the manors of Old Shoreham,
<i>alias</i> Vetus Shoreham, <i>alias</i> Rusper, and Portslade;
but the boundaries of them are at the present day very
undefined.&nbsp; Mr. Harry Colvill Bridger is the present lord of
the manor of Old Shoreham.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> IV.<br />
AFTER THE CONQUEST, TO 1513.</h2>
<p>It is highly probable, from the surnames of some of the most
ancient families in the town of Brighthelmston, the phrases, and
the pronunciation of the old natives, and some peculiar customs
of the people, that the town had, at some distant period,
received a colony of Flemings.&nbsp; This might have happened
soon after the conquest, as a great inundation of the sea took
place in Flanders about that period; and such of the unfortunate
inhabitants of the <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>deluged country as wanted new habitations, could not
have anywhere applied with a greater likelihood of success than
in England, as Matilda, queen of William the Conqueror, was their
countrywoman, being daughter of Baldwin, Earl of Flanders.</p>
<p>Being thus settled in Brighthelmston, the Flemings were led by
habits and situation, to direct their chief attention to the
fishery of the Channel.&nbsp; Besides obtaining a plentiful
supply of fresh fish of the best kind and quality for themselves
and their inland neighbours, they, every season, cured a great
number of herrings, and exported them to various parts of the
continent, where the abstinence of Lent, the vigils, and other
meagre days, insured them a constant market.&nbsp; There is no
doubt, but, from time to time, additions were made to this
foreign colony, from Spain, France, and Holland, as the names of
some of the oldest families of the town verify; namely, Mighell
(Miguel), Gunn (Juan), Jasper (Gaspard), Jeffery (Geoffrey),
Gillam (Guillaume), &amp;c.</p>
<p>The inhabitants were now classed into landsmen and seamen, or
mariners, and they profited respectively by the advantages of
their situation.&nbsp; The former, whose dwellings were on the
cliff and part of the gentle acclivity behind it, drew health and
competence from the fertile soil; while the latter, who resided
in two streets beneath the cliff, found a bountiful source of
subsistence and profit at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; In process
of time, the mariners and their families, principally descendants
from the new comers, the Flemings, had increased in numbers so
far as to compose more than two-thirds of the population of the
town, and they had a proportionate share of the offices and
internal regulation of the parish.</p>
<p>The Flemish, on their arrival, though received in all
probability as vassals, found their condition an improvement on
the general state-<i>villeinage</i>; and the indulgence shown to
foreigners was eventually extended to the natives; and the
disfranchised landholders gradually emerged from the most abject
state of feudal dependence, to one less precarious, that of
tenants by copy of court roll.&nbsp; Once registered on the rolls
of a manor, with the consent of the lord or his steward, their
title became indefeasible and descendible to their heirs, except
in case of neglect or violation <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of the definite and recorded duties
of their tenure.&nbsp; Thus settled, the husbandmen of
Brighthelmston had every inducement to marriage, and they toiled
with pleasure in their patrimonial field.&nbsp; The mariner also,
freed from feudal caprice, braved the dangers of the deep, not
only for his subsistence, but as a future provision for his
family; and transmitted to his posterity, controlled by manorial
custom, his ship or boat, his cottage, his capstan and garden,
and other monuments of his paternal solicitude and
industry.&nbsp; The town being, as now, a member of the port of
Shoreham,&mdash;all boats of the town register at
Shoreham,&mdash;was obliged to furnish some seamen for the royal
navy; and no other tax or service was imposed upon the
inhabitants, till the levying of a poll-tax in the reign of
Edward III.</p>
<p>In 1313 Brighthelmston had become so considerable as to need
the public accommodation of a market; and John, the eighth and
last Earl de Warren, obtained a charter of Edward III. for
holding a market every Thursday.</p>
<p>The mariners about this time, in the Lower Town, or under
Cliff, increasing in number and property, extended their
habitations to the Upper Town, and began two streets westward of
the Stein, named from their situations, East Street and West
Street, forming the inhabited limits of the town in those
directions.&nbsp; After East Street and West street had been
continued some considerable way towards the north, the landsmen,
who were also becoming numerous, found it necessary to build
intermediate streets, parallel to those already constructed; and
the proprietor of the north <i>laines</i>, finding it more
convenient to have their barns, and finally, their own dwellings
and the cottages for their workmen, at that extremity of the
town, formed North Street.</p>
<p>Most of the ground now occupied by Black Lion street and Ship
street, and the intermediate space, are, in all the Court Rolls,
called the Hempshares; and were, even after East street and West
street were built, plots or gardens for the production of hemp,
for the use of the fishermen of the town.&nbsp; The name of the
ropemaker who constructed all the cordage for the supply of the
fishery, was Anthony Smith, who, in 1670 suffered great
persecution from Captain Nicholas Tattersal, a personage who
assumed great power <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>when basking in the smiles of royalty, consequent upon
his effecting the escape of Charles II. to France.&nbsp; Smith
was more especially the object of his malignity, from having been
the occupier of the house, in West street, where the king
sojourned preparatory to his flight; he happening to recognise
His Majesty, yet having too much loyalty to betray him.&nbsp;
Jealousy actuated him; as he was desirous of claiming all the
honour in the royal escape.&nbsp; He in consequence kept all the
merits, which were really due to Smith, in the background, and
took all the honour to himself, and the reward to.&nbsp; In
process of time, as the population increased, and the sea made
encroachments on the lower town, two streets were erected on the
site of the hemp-shares or gardens.&nbsp; In the most eastern
street of these, with one front to the High street,&mdash;that
which passed along the verge of the Cliff,&mdash;stood an Inn,
with a Black Lion for its sign; and in the other there was an
Inn, with a Ship for its sign.&nbsp; The two streets of the
hemp-shares were soon distinguished by the two signs, and are the
present Black-Lion street and Ship street.&nbsp; The Black-Lion
Inn on the east side of the street, was converted into a private
residence about the beginning of the present century.&nbsp; The
Ship, the oldest tavern in the town, is now, and has been since
1650, known as the Old Ship, to distinguish it from the New Ship,
a more recent erection.&nbsp; Besides the hemp-shares, the ground
to the west of the town, which was afterwards brick-yards, and is
now termed the Brunswick Square and Terrace district, was devoted
to the growing of flax for the use of the fishermen.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the town received a check about the middle
of the fourteenth century, from the ambitious projects of Edward
III. against France, which exposed this and other fishing towns
of the southern coast to the occasional retaliation of that
kingdom.&nbsp; The inhabitants&rsquo; boats were taken, and their
fishery frequently interrupted.&nbsp; In 1377 the French burnt
and plundered most of the towns from Portsmouth to Hastings; but
no particular injury to the town is recorded of Brighton, at that
period.&nbsp; When, however, there was the least appearance of
danger, the coast Watch and Ward, called in the king&rsquo;s
mandate <i>Vigili&aelig; minut&aelig;</i>, were called into
service.&nbsp; Their duties were nocturnal, and seldom exacted,
unless an immediate descent was apprehended.&nbsp; The watch
consisted <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>of men at arms, and <i>hobilers</i> or <i>hoblers</i>,
who were a sort of light cavalry that were bound to perform the
service by the nature of their tenure.&nbsp; They were dressed in
jackets called hobils, and were mounted on swift horses.&nbsp;
The bold stand made against the French, in 1377, when they landed
at Rottingdean, was principally by the watch and ward-keepers of
the coast, which had been divided into districts, entrusted to
the care of some baron, or religious house, by certain
commissioners, called Rectores Commitatus.&nbsp; In the annals of
the Prior of Lewes, and the Abbot of Battle, we find that those
personages were several times placed at the head of an armed
power, to oppose actual or threatened invasion.&nbsp; Certain
borough hundreds were also obliged, under pain of forfeiture or
other penalty, to keep the beacons in proper condition, and to
fire them at the approach of an enemy, in order to alarm and
assemble the inhabitants in the Weald.</p>
<p>From the constant alarm of the people and the ruin of war,
Brighthelmston generally experienced a considerable share of the
public distress; as, besides contributing some of its best
mariners for manning the royal fleet, the town was deprived of
its trade and fishery.&nbsp; In 1512, in consequence of war being
declared by Henry VIII. against Louis XII., all the maritime
industry of Brighthelmston suffered, and its buildings were
threatened with plunder and conflagration.&nbsp; At this time,
Sir Edward Howard, the English Admiral, having made several
successful attempts on the coast of Brittany, and being joined by
a squadron of ships commanded by Sir Thomas Knivet, went in
pursuit of the French fleet, under the command of Admiral
Primauget, Knight of Rhodes; the real intention being to destroy
the town of Brest.&nbsp; The French fleet, consisting of
thirty-nine ships, was in the harbour of Brest.&nbsp; Howard,
having been misled by the information and advice of a Spanish
Knight, named Caroz, as to the strength of Primauget&rsquo;s
force, entered the bay under the fire of two strong batteries,
which commanded the entrance, with only a barge and three
galleys, and took possession himself, of the French
Admiral&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But the French soon recovered from their
panic, the two fleets met, and a furious engagement ensued.&nbsp;
At length Primauget&rsquo;s ship was set on fire, and determining
not to perish alone, he bore down upon the <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>English
Admiral&rsquo;s, and, grappling with her, both ships soon became
involved in the same inevitable destruction.&nbsp; This dreadful
scene suspended the action between the other ships; but after
some time, the French ship blew up, and in its explosion
destroyed the English ship.&nbsp; While the conflict was at its
height, and the deck was streaming with the blood of his brave
companions, Sir Edward was thrust with a half-pike into the sea
and perished.</p>
<p>After this misfortune, the English fleet returned home; and
Primauget&rsquo;s being reinforced from Brest, and being animated
with his recent success, he sailed for the coast of Sussex, to
wreak that vengeance on the inhabitants which was due to Henry
alone.&nbsp; He accordingly, in the night time, landed some men,
who plundered it of everything valuable that they could remove,
set many houses on fire, and wantonly slew many of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; The rest flying in terror and confusion
different ways, the country became alarmed as far as Lewes and
the Weald. <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; The French re-embarked the next
morning, with their booty, before the country people could
assemble in any force to annoy them.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Howard,
brother of Sir Edward, whom he succeeded, soon after, with Sir
John Wallop, made a descent on the coast of Normandy, and
desolated no less than twenty-one towns and villages, inhabited
by people who never did, and perhaps never wished to do, any
injury to their fellow men on this wide the Channel.&nbsp; Such
is the fortune, and such are the advantages and distinctions of
the royal game of war.</p>
<p>Holinshead mentions an attack upon the town by the French,
about this time; and there is the probability that he refers to
the same invasion, as he terms it a nocturnal visit from some <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>French ships,
but commanded by Prior Jehan, the high admiral.&nbsp; He says:
&ldquo;but when the people began to gather, by firing the
beacons, Prior Jehan sounded his trumpet to call his men aboard,
and by that time it was day.&nbsp; The certain archers that kept
the watch followed Prior Jehan to the sea, and shot so fast that
they beat the galley men from the shore, and wounded many in the
fleet: to which Prior Jehan was constrained to wade, and was shot
in the face with an arrow, so that he lost one of his eyes, and
was like to have died of the hurt, and therefore he offered his
image of wax before our Lady at Bullogne, with the English arrow
in the face, for a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the Burrell MSS., <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a> in 1589, strict
orders were given for maintaining beacons in all accustomed
places, with orders to the watchmen, that if the number of
invading ships did not exceed two, they were not to fire the
beacons, but to cause larums to be rung from church to church as
far as the skirts of the hill reached from the sea shore, and no
further; and to send a post to the nearest justices: but if the
ships exceeded two, they were to fire both their beacons, which
were to be duly answered by the corresponding ones, and thus
rouse the &ldquo;force of the shire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Five discreet
householders in the neighbourhood, were assigned to each beacon,
one to keep watch constantly.&nbsp; In 1590, the beacon watches
were ordered to be discharged till further orders.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> V.<br />
ANCIENT AND MODERN GOVERNMENT OF THE TOWN.</h2>
<p>When king Alfred divided England into shires, the shires into
hundreds, and the hundreds into tithings, tithing men or
headboroughs&mdash;<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>heads of boroughs&mdash;were the only guardians of the
peace, and dispensers of justice within their respective
districts, the original limits being the residences of ten
<i>creorles</i> or freemen, with their families and slaves.&nbsp;
Under the Saxon constitution, Brighton had two headboroughs; a
proof that its population, even then, was far from being
inconsiderable.&nbsp; These headboroughs sat alternately or
together, at the borough court, at which the decenners, or free,
or frankpledges (friborgs) as had no causes to be tried there,
attended as jurors or sworn assessors to the presiding
officer.&nbsp; These free-pledges were the origin of the Society
of Twelve, which continued in Brighthelmston to the commencement
of the present century.</p>
<p>By the statute of Winchester, 13th Edward I., the borough of
Brighthelmston had a constable appointed for itself exclusively,
an indication of its respectability at that period.&nbsp;
According to Alfred&rsquo;s division, the hundred to which
Brighthelmston belonged, contained, besides that borough, those
of Ovingdean and Rottingdean, called in Domesday,
<i>Welesmere</i>.&nbsp; The boroughs of Preston (Prestetune) and
Patcham (Patchame), which were originally hundreds of themselves,
were, under Edward I., united to the borough of Brighthelmston,
and composed a new hundred, called <i>Wellsbourne</i>, since
corrupted into Whalesbone.&nbsp; The boroughs of Ovingdean and
Rottingdean were then united to the small hundred of Falmer,
under the name of <i>Evensmere</i>.</p>
<p>Wellsbourne took its name from a stream which till within the
last few years ran, in the winter time, nearly the whole length
of the hundred.&nbsp; It rose near the upper end of Patcham
street, and entered the sea at the Pool,&mdash;Pool
Valley,&mdash;in Brighthelmston.&nbsp; Within the last thirty
years it burst out with so large a current as to inundate the
Level to the north of the town, and even the greatest part of the
Stein.&nbsp; In the spring of 1806 it laid the north of the town
under water.&nbsp; After the last inundation, in the winter of
1827&ndash;8, a large sewer, called the Northern Drain, was laid
down from the northern boundary of the London Road, to the sea,
its outlet being in front of the Albion Hotel.&nbsp; The source
of this stream or bourne, being the well at Patcham, it had its
name from that circumstance, and lent it to the said hundred.</p>
<p>The <i>leet</i> or law day, the view of frankpledge for this
hundred, <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>was held on Easter Tuesday, when all the officers of the
hundred, except the headborough of Patcham, were elected.&nbsp;
The Constable of Brighthelmston was always chosen by and out of
the Twelve of the town.&nbsp; The headborough, afterwards styled
the constable of the borough of Deane or Patcham, was nominated
in rotation for that office, according to the particular lands he
held within the borough.&nbsp; From and after 1618, by
arrangement between the two classes of inhabitants, the fishermen
and the landsmen, &ldquo;Twelve out of the ancientest, gravest,
and wysest inhabitants of the town, eight fishermen and four
landsmen, were selected for assistants to the conestable in every
public cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; The constable was then termed the High
Constable, and his twelve assistants were called
Headboroughs.&nbsp; The constable of Brighthelmston served at
Quarter Sessions, musters, and other public services for the
whole hundred, the constable of the Deane being only his
assistant or deputy within the borough of the Deane or
Patcham.&nbsp; There was also chosen at the leet or law day for
this hundred, which is in the deanery of Lewes, an ale-conner and
a searcher or sealer of leather.&nbsp; Since the town became
incorporated, in 1854, no headboroughs have been chosen; but Mr
James Martin, who was appointed at the last annual Court Leet of
the Earl of Abergavenny, by the steward of the Leet, F. H. Gell,
Esq., on Easter Tuesday, 1855, continues the High Constable of
the Hundred of Whalesbone: his duties however are very trifling,
merely consisting of taking charge of the Parish Jury List, and
presenting it to the Clerk of the Peace for the County.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the Constables who have served the
Hundred as far as the records of them are made in the Town Books,
or other proofs are given:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 5th of April, 1793, at a Vestry Meeting held at the
Town Hall, it was ordered: &ldquo;That in future the Constable
(High) be allowed twelve guineas, to be paid in full, for all
expenses during his office, including four guineas for a
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was customary at the Court Leet, each Easter, to choose a
High-Constable Elect, but he was not always appointed at the next
Court; as, in 1814, Mr. Ackerson was chosen, although Mr. W.
Williams was the elect.</p>

THE BOOK OF ALL THE &ldquo;AUNCIENT CUSTOMS.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In consequence of the perpetual jealousies and strife between
the fishermen and landsmen, a commission was sent to Brighton, in
1580, to settle every difference, assess the town rates, and
arrange the public concerns of the parish.&nbsp; The Earl of
Arundel, Lord Buckhurst (Lord of the Manor), Sir Thomas Shirley,
of Preston, and Henry Shelley, Esq., were the
commissioners.&nbsp; The number of landsmen who at that time paid
parochial rates and taxes, was 102; while the number of fishermen
amounted to 400.&nbsp; The decision of the commissioners gave
satisfaction to all parties till 1618, when a fresh arrangement
was entered into.&nbsp; The orders and regulations of these two
commissions were directed to be &ldquo;written in two several
books of parchment,&rdquo; one of which was to be delivered to
the Earl of Arundel and Lord Buckhurst, the other was to
&ldquo;be kepte in a cheaste locked with three locks, in some
convenient place in Brighthelmston.&rdquo;&nbsp; Provision was
made also for the safe custody of the key of the chest, and for
the annual reading of the regulations by the Vicar,
&ldquo;openlye in the presence of all the fishermen and others of
the parishioners, contributaries, in some convenient time and
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Book of all the Auncient Customs,&rdquo; is dated
23rd July, in the 32nd year of Queen Elizabeth, 1580; and is kept
in its original shape in a spacious box, at the office of Messrs.
Attree, Clarke, and Howlett, solicitors, Ship Street.&nbsp; It is
in black letter, on parchment, and is in a state of good
preservation, although the ink, from age, is very yellow.&nbsp;
An engrossed copy in corrected modern authority, is deposited
with it, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>In the Manors of Brighthelmston</i>, <i>as
Parcel of the Barony of Lewes</i>, <i>the following Feudal
Customs</i>, <i>partly of Saxon origin</i>, <i>but established
for the most part by the Norman settlers in this country</i>,
<i>have</i>, <i>by immemorial usage</i>, <i>governed the Courts
there</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The lands of <i>copyholders</i> in these manors are
descendible, on death, to the youngest son, or to the youngest
daughter if there be no son, and so on to the youngest relatives
collaterally. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The widow of a purchaser of a copyhold estate to
which he has been <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>admitted, or the widow of an heir by descent, though
unadmitted, may, after three courts to be holden next after her
husband&rsquo;s death, claim her <i>widow&rsquo;s bench</i>, and
shall be admitted for her life, even though she marry again, she
paying the lord a reasonable fine, not exceeding one year&rsquo;s
value of the land.&nbsp; But if the husband, even on his
death-bed, make a surrender of his copyhold, the widow shall not
have her <i>bench</i>, nor the widow of a purchaser unadmitted,
nor the widow of a tenant in reversion.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; All the tenants of these manors, except such as were
discharged by deed, or held by knight&rsquo;s service, held their
lands by <i>suite of court</i>, the <i>copyholder</i> from three
weeks to three weeks, and to be of the homage: the
<i>freeholders</i> were to appear only twice a-year, viz., at the
courts holden at Easter and Michaelmas, where, if they knew of
any wrong done to the lord, they were bound by their oath of
fealty, to make it known to the court.&nbsp; But they (the
<i>freeholders</i>) were not to be of the homage, because they
performed service at juries at the <i>barony court</i>, held from
three weeks to three weeks at <i>Lewes</i>; from which service
the copyholders were exempt.&nbsp; The defaulters at each court
were to be <i>essoyned</i> (excused) or <i>assirred</i> (fined)
in proportion to their offence.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Surrenders made out of court, and presented at the
next general court holden for the manor, are good.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The heir in possession of a customary tenement, being
above the age of fourteen years, or he or she to whose use any
surrender shall be made, being of the like age, not coming into
court on or before the third half-yearly proclamation, shall
forfeit his or her estate.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; If a <i>copyholder</i> leave an heir under the age of
fourteen years, such heir is, during his or her minority, to be
committed to the care of the next of kin who is able to answer
for the profits of the land, and to whom the land cannot
descend.&nbsp; At the age of fourteen years the heir may choose a
guardian.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>Relief</i> and <i>Heriot</i> were due to the lords
of these manors on the death of every freeholder, not discharged
by deed, who died seized of an estate of inheritance of soccage
tenure.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; On the death or surrender of a tenant for life, no
<i>heriot</i> is due, except for a stinted <i>cottage</i>; nor of
a joint tenant: or if a tenant in fee surrender to one of his
heirs, part of his customary tenement, and reserve another part
to himself and heirs, no <i>heriot</i> is due, because he is
still tenant of the <i>heriotable</i> tenement.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; No more than one <i>heriot</i> is, by custom,
claimable for any number of tenements in one manor, belonging to
the deceased.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; The <i>copyholder</i> was to keep his customary
tenement in repair, and for that purpose, may cut down on his
copyhold the necessary timber, in case the lord, his steward,
woodward, or reeve refuse to assign him any for that purpose.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; If any tenant, free or customary, alien parcel of
his tenement, and the rent be apportioned in court with the
lord&rsquo;s or the steward&rsquo;s consent, it concludes with
the lord and tenant.&nbsp; Otherwise the lord may distrain any
part of the tenement for the whole rent.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; The heir of every tenant, being fourteen years of
age, after the death of his ancestor dying seized of customary
lands or tenements, as also a purchaser, upon surrender of such
lands either in possession or reversion to his use, coming into
the court at or before the third proclamation, and desiring to be
admitted, shall have a reasonable fine assessed by the lord or
his steward, not exceeding one year&rsquo;s value of the land;
which fine the tenant is to pay on his admittance, or shortly
after; otherwise he forfeits his estate.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; If a tenant let to farm his <i>copyhold</i> for more
than one year and a day at a time, he is to come to the
lord&rsquo;s court for license, which the lord is to grant, the
tenant paying him <i>four-pence</i>, and no more, for every year
so granted, with a reservation of the lord&rsquo;s customs,
duties, and services.&nbsp; Also the <i>copyholder</i>, having <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>a barn on his
copyhold, is to pay the lord <i>four-pence</i>, or less, but
never more, for every wainload of corn or hay that grows on his
said copyhold, and is carried out of the manor with license, or
to any freehold within the manor.&nbsp; But the tenant may carry
corn or hay from one copyhold to another on the same manor,
without license, where the two copyholds have equal
estates.&nbsp; But if one be a guardian, or a tenant for life,
and another tenant in fee, and any manure be removed from the
former estate to the latter, the party, so doing, shall be
amerced.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; If a <i>copyholder</i> alien his lands by
<i>deed</i>, pull down his building without license, or wilfully
suffer it to fall, commit any wilful waste, let his tenement for
more than one year and a day without license, obstinately refuse
to pay his rent, or a reasonable fine upon admittance, or absent
himself, without sufficient cause, from the lord&rsquo;s court
after lawful summons, or, being there, will not be sworn of the
homage, without satisfactory excuse, or carry all his corn from
the copyhold, if he have a barn there, he is, for any of these
offences, liable to forfeit his estate in the said copyhold.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; <i>Strays</i>, found within any of these manors, and
proclaimed according to the statute, after a year and a day are
passed, become the property of the lord of that manor, by
prescription.&nbsp; Every lord is to maintain a common pound
within his manor.&nbsp; But, of latter time, all <i>strays</i>
within the <i>rape</i> and <i>liberties</i> of the barony of
<i>Lewes</i>, have, by consent of the lords, been presented at
the <i>law days</i> or <i>leet</i> holden for the hundred in
which the <i>strays</i> are found.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; In each of these manors there was a <i>Reeve</i>,
who was the lord&rsquo;s immediate officer.&nbsp; His name and
institution are both of Saxon origin.&nbsp; The <i>Thane</i> who
generally presided in person at his own court, had at first no
other officer belonging to it than the <i>Gerefa</i> or
<i>Reve</i>, who generally received a settlement on the manor, in
consideration of his services; and thus, in most manors, did the
office become predial, or attached to some particular
lands.&nbsp; In some manors however, it was not confined to one
denomination only, but imposed on several of the tenants in
rotation, by virtue of their tenure.&nbsp; This officer&rsquo;s
duty is to account to the lord or his steward, for all the
ancient quit-rents both of freehold and copyhold, and all the
heriots that fall due within the manor, together with the fines,
leviable amercements, and all the other casual profits within the
same.&nbsp; But he is not bound to audit out of the manor, unless
the lord will recompense him for his pains; nor even then, unless
he chooses it.&nbsp; Being an officer of great antiquity, he is
not bound to collect any but <i>old rents</i>, which were payable
before the eighteenth year of <i>Edward the First</i>.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; The majority of the homagers sworn at the
lord&rsquo;s court, for the better preservation of order, have,
time beyond all memory of man, with the lord&rsquo;s consent,
used to make bye-laws for the establishment of the common good,
and for preventing of public annoyances: and such laws made with
reasonable penalties and clauses for distress for such penalties,
have been immemorially binding and concluding to all tenants of
the manor, provided such laws or orders cross not the general
laws and statutes of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Though many of the following Customs and Regulations are now
become obsolete, they are in general too interesting to be
omitted in the History of the town.</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon supplication <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> by the ancient
fishermen of Brighthelmston, unto the Right Honourable the Lords
of the Council, for remedy and redress of certain disorders in
their town, touching the annual payment of certain money called a
<i>quarter of a share</i>, heretofore of ancient time usually
paid out of every boat in every <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>fishing voyage, to the churchwardens
there, towards the maintenance of their church, and other public
charges about the necessary defence of their town; and for a
contribution by the rest of the parishioners, not being
fishermen, toward the bearing of the said charges to be had and
levied: and after commission by the means of the Lord
<i>Buckhurst</i>, for the purposes aforesaid, obtained from the
Lords of her Majesty&rsquo;s Most Honourable Privy Council, unto
the Right Honourable Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, the said Lord
<i>Buckhurst</i>, Sir <i>Thomas Shirley</i>, Knight, and
<i>Richard Shelley</i>, Esquire, or to any two of them directed,
bearing date the 12th day of February, <i>in anno Domini</i>,
1579, it pleased the said Lord <i>Buckhurst</i> and Sir <i>Thomas
Shirley</i>, by authority thereof, to will and command certain of
the said ancient fishermen to set down in writing their ancient
customs and orders, concerning the true making, payment, and
employing of the said <i>quarter share</i>, and the certainty
thereof; which they, the said ancient fishermen, being assembled
together, have done accordingly in manner and form here
following.</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used for</i> <span class="smcap">Tucknet
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Imprimis</i>, there have used, time
out of mind, between February and April yearly, certain small
boats called <i>Tuckers</i>, to go to sea upon the coast for
plaice, of the burden of three tons or thereabouts.&nbsp; Every
of these boats have used eight or nine men, or thereabouts, and
two nets.&nbsp; Every man hath used to take for his body in this
voyage, a share.&nbsp; The boat, the nets and necessaries thereto
belonging, hath used to take four shares: and besides, one other
share hath been used to be made, whereof half is due to the
Vicar, a quarter to the master, and the other quarter to the
Churchwardens, for the use of the town: so that every boat in
this voyage, having eight men, taking a share a man, maketh
thirteen shares, viz., for eight men eight shares; for the boat,
the nets, and necessaries, four shares; and for the Vicar, the
town, and the master, one share; and if there be more or less
men, then the shares are more or less in number, according to the
number of the men proportionably.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span class="smcap">Shotnet
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>, there have yearly, time
out of mind, from April to June, used to go to sea for mackarel,
other boats called <i>shotters</i>, of diverse burdens between
six tons and twenty-six tons.&nbsp; Every boat of the burden of
six tons, and not above ten tons, hath used to take two shares;
and above ten tons, and under eighteen tons, two shares and a
half; and from eighteen tons to the biggest, three shares.&nbsp;
Every man having above four nets going to sea in this voyage,
hath used to take for his body, half a share, and not above; and
every other man hath used to take for his body, a share, and not
above: and the nets have accustomably contained in length between
thirty and twenty-four fathoms, and in deepness two <i>ranns</i>,
every <i>rann</i> fifty <i>moxes</i> deep, whereof every four
nets have used to take a share; so that every boat in this
voyage, taking two shares and a half, having ten men, taking a
share a man, and having four score nets, maketh thirty-three
shares and a half, viz., for four score nets twenty shares; for
ten men, ten shares; for the boat, two shares and a half; for the
Vicar, the town, and the master, one share; and if there be more
or less men, or the boat be lesser or bigger of burden, or have
less or more number of nets, then the shares are more or leas in
number, according to the proportion of the boat, men and
nets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span
class="smcap">Scarborough Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Item.&nbsp;
There have, since the memory of man, yearly, from June to
September, other boats of divers burden between eighteen and
forty tons, used a voyage to <i>Scarborough</i> to fish for cod
(being about forty years agon).&nbsp; Every boat in this voyage,
of the burden of eighteen tons, and not above twenty-eight tons,
hath used to take four shares; and from twenty-eight to the
biggest, five shares.&nbsp; Every man in the biggest sort of
these boats, bringing with him a line, a lead, four lines of
hooks, and two norward nets, containing twenty-four yards in
length, or thereabouts, hath used to take for his body, and the
necessaries aforesaid, one share: and in the smallest sort, every
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>man
bringing with him two lines, two leads, and one <i>heak</i>, <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> containing twenty-eight yards in
length, and five ranns in deepness, hath used to take a share and
a half; and having two lines, two leads, and two <i>heaks</i>, of
the length and deepness aforesaid, two shares: so that every boat
in this voyage taking four shares, having twelve men, taking two
shares a man, maketh in number twenty-nine shares, viz., for the
boat, four shares; for twelve men, twenty-four shares; for the
vicar, the town, and the master, one share: and the number of
shares is varied more or less according to the number of men and
nets, or the bigness of the boat, according to the proportion of
this example.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span class="smcap">Yarmouth
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Item.&nbsp; There have yearly, time out
of mind, from September unto November, used to go to
<i>Yarmouth</i> to fish for herrings, other boats of divers
burden, between fifteen tons and forty tons; every boat of the
burden of fifteen tons and not above twenty-four tons, taking
three shares; and every boat of twenty-four tons and not above
thirty tons, taking three shares and a half; and from thirty to
the biggest, taking four shares.&nbsp; Every man in this voyage
used to take for his body half-a-share: and these boats have used
two sorts of nets, the one sort called <i>flews</i>, alias
<i>heaks</i>, containing between thirty and twenty-four fathoms
in length, and in deepness four ranns, every rann fifty
<i>moxes</i> <a name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> deep, every three of these nets taking
a share; the other sort, called norward nets, containing between
fifteen and ten fathoms in length, and in deepness five ranns,
every rann fifty moxes deep; every four of these nets taking a
share: so that every boat in this voyage, taking three shares and
a half, having twelve men, taking a share a man, and having
thirty-six flews, alias heaks, and thirty-two norward nets, every
four norward nets taking a share, maketh thirty shares in the
whole number, and one half-share, viz., for the boat, three
shares and a half; for twelve men, six shares; for thirty-six
flews, twelve shares; for thirty-two norward nets, eight shares;
for the vicar, the town, and the master, one share; and if there
be more or less number of men and nets, or if the boat be bigger
or lesser, then the shares are more or less in number, according
to that proportion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span class="smcap">Cock
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Item.&nbsp; There have, time out of
mind, between October and the midst of December, used to go to
sea upon the coast for herrings, certain small boats called
<i>cocks</i> <a name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a> of burden, between two and six
tons.&nbsp; Every of these boats having a mast and a sail, hath
used to take a share and a half; and the other, without mast or
sail, have taken a share.&nbsp; These boats have used two sorts
of nets, the one called <i>cock heaks</i>, containing between
thirty and twenty-four fathoms in length, and two ranns in
deepness, and the other called <i>flews</i>, containing the
length aforesaid, and three ranns in deepness.&nbsp; These two
sorts of nets have used to take for three nets a share, one with
another; so that a boat in this voyage taking a share and a half,
having six men, and twenty-four nets, maketh ten shares and a
half, viz., for the boat, one share and a half; for six men, six
shares; for twenty-four nets, eight shares; and for the Vicar,
the town, and the master, one share; and so the shares do vary,
more or less in number, according to the bigness of the boat, and
the number of men and nets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span class="smcap">Flew
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Item.&nbsp; There have, time out of
mind, between the beginning of November and the end of December,
used to go to the sea for herrings, other boats, called
<i>flewers</i>, of divers burden, between eight tons and twenty
tons, the biggest boat taking three shares, the smallest two
shares.&nbsp; <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Every man having above three nets going to sea in this
voyage, hath used to take for his body half a share, and every
other man a share, and none above.&nbsp; These boats have used
one sort of nets, called flews, containing between thirty and
twenty-four fathoms in length, and three ranns in deepness, every
rann fifty moxes deep, every three nets taking a share: so that
every boat taking three shares, having eight men, taking half a
share a man, and having thirty-nine nets, maketh twenty-one
shares, viz., for the boat, three shares; for eight men, four
shares; for thirty-nine nets, thirteen shares; and one share for
the vicar, the town, and the master, or more or less shares
according to the number of men and nets, and the bigness of the
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span class="smcap">Harbour
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Item.&nbsp; There have used, time out
of mind, another sort of boats to go to sea in summer time, with
harbour hooks for <i>conger</i>, every boat containing eight tons
or thereabouts, and taking for every boat two shares; and every
man having four lines of hooks, every line containing fifty
fathoms, taketh a share; and twelve lines of hooks without a man
taketh a share.&nbsp; So that a boat having twelve men taking a
share a man, and twelve lines of hooks without men, maketh in
number fifteen shares, viz., for the boat, two shares; for twelve
men, twelve shares; for twelve lines of hooks, one share; and one
share for the vicar, the town, and the master, or more or less
number of shares according to the number of men and
hooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom used in</i> <span class="smcap">Drawnet
Fare</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Item.&nbsp; There have used, time out
of mind, in the months of May and June, yearly, certain small
<i>cocks</i>, of the burden of three tons, or thereabouts, to
draw mackarel by the shore, whereof the boat and the net take one
half, the other half is divided by shares unto the men, to every
man a share; and one share is also thereof made for the vicar,
the town, and the master: so that if there be ten men, then they
make eleven shares, viz., ten men, ten shares; and one share for
the vicar, the town, and the master; and if there be more men,
then they make more shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Ancient Custom for Payment and Employing the</i> <span
class="smcap">Quarter
Share</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; The master of every
boat at <i>Brighthelmston</i>, at <i>St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day</i>,
next after his return from any fishing voyage, wheresoever or
whensoever it was begun, had, or continued, hath used to divide
and pay out of the whole profits of the said boat, without
diminution or deduction to any stranger going in the said boat,
to be made, the said <i>quarter share</i> unto the Churchwardens
of <i>Brighthelmston</i> for the time being, and half a share to
the vicar there for the time being, and the other he hath for his
own use.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; The master of
every boat of <i>Brighthelmston</i> had, time out of mind, used
to take up and pay out of the whole profits of every voyage,
whether the rest of his companions be of <i>Brighthelmston</i>,
or strangers of other parishes, the said whole share for the
vicar, the town, and himself, without any deduction thereof unto
any other town or parish, or the parson, vicar, or proprietary
thereof, to be made: and if the master, or any of his company,
have been of <i>Brighthelmston</i>, and the boat belonging to any
other place, then the said master also hath used to make in the
said boat the aforesaid share, whereof he hath had a quarter to
himself, and of the other three quarters for the town and vicar
of <i>Brighthelmston</i>, he hath used to have proportionably,
according to the number of men and nets which he used and had out
of <i>Brighthelmston</i> in the
voyage.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; The said wardens
used to employ the said quarter share, especially upon building
of forts and walls towards the sea, for the defence of the said
town, and for provision of shot and powder, and other furniture
for that purpose; and entertainment of soldiers in time of wars,
and other public service of the prince, and maintenance of the
parish church.&nbsp; Whereupon, to the intent that the said
annual payment, or quarter share, for the better defence and
maintenance of the said town, may, in time to come, justly and
truly, without fraud, be both made, yielded, and paid; and also
preserved, kept, and employed, according to their ancient custom;
as also for the avoiding of all such <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>controversies as heretofore have

and is before ordered, and not otherwise; and the same shall well
and truly pay yearly, upon the feast of <i>St. Stephen</i>, to

successors, in presence of the constable, the vicar or curate,
and the parishioners, upon pain of forfeiting by him or them that
shall do the contrary, forty shillings, and shall be chargeable
nevertheless with his account before the
Commissioners.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; Every
forfeiture before or hereafter mentioned growing by reason of any
matter pertaining to the sea or fishing, shall be paid unto the
wardens being fishermen, and every other forfeiture unto the land
wardens.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; If the
Churchwardens shall neglect to demand any of the said forfeitures
for the space of six days next after his or their knowledge
thereof, then he or they for every time so neglecting, shall pay
unto the poor man&rsquo;s box of <i>Brighthelmston</i>, three
shillings and four pence, or else answer it before the
Commissioners.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; Whosoever
shall not, within five days next after demand in that case by the
wardens, or any of them, for the time being, to be made, pay unto
the said wardens, or one of them, all such of the said
forfeitures as they then from time to time, at any time
hereafter, shall have made, then his or their name or names not
paying such forfeitures as aforesaid, shall be signified in
writing under the hands of the constable, the vicar or curate,
and the said wardens, unto the Commissioners, to be bound to
appear before the lords of the
Council.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; That so much of
the said quarter share as shall amount to the double value of the
contribution (of the landmen) shall be kept employed and
accounted for indifferently by all the Churchwardens in such sort
as is aforesaid, and the residue of the said quarter share shall
be remaining in custody of the sea-wardens, who shall not employ
or disburse any part or parcel thereof, but for the common profit
of the town, and that only with the consent of the constable,
being a fisherman, the vicar, and six other fishermen being of
the <i>Twelve</i>, in writing first had and obtained, and thereof
shall make a true and particular account in writing, in the
presence of the said constable, churchwardens, and fishermen, at
the time accustomed; and the money remaining shall then yield up
unto the sea-wardens, their successors, upon pain to forfeit for
every time doing the contrary, the double value of every sum,
contrary to this order, employed, not accounted for, or not
yielded up as aforesaid, and shall be chargeable also with the
same before the
commissioners.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; The rents,
profits, and commodities of the mill and town house, and of all
other lands, tenements, and hereditaments which now do belong and
appertain, or hereafter shall belong and appertain to the said
town of <i>Brighthelmston</i>, shall be yearly paid and answered
unto the churchwardens; and that the same, and every part
thereof, shall and may, from time to time, be disposed, demised,
and let out to farm, for the term of seven years at the most, by
the said constables and wardens, so as always the same be done to
the best profit and commodity of the said town, upon pain that
every one therein offending, shall forfeit five pounds, and
besides to answer for his offence in that behalf before the said
commissioners.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; The same
churchwardens, shall have in readiness at all times hereafter, in
some convenient place in <i>Brighthelmston</i>, to be laid up in
store, and safely kept, four barrels of powder, and forty round
shot, and ten chain shot for every great
piece.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; There shall be
selected by the said commissioners out of the ancientest,
gravest, and wisest inhabitants, eight fishermen and four
landsmen, for assistants to the constable in every public cause,
whereof every one shall be ready, and give his attendance upon
the constable as oft as need shall require: and whosoever shall
presume to call together any assembly, to the intent to practice
or put in use any manner, or device, or art touching the
government of the said town, without the privity, consent, and
command of the said constable and assistants shall forfeit for
every time so doing, forty shillings.&nbsp; And to the intent
that the said <i>Twelve</i> grave and wise men may have
continuance, therefore, upon the death or removing of any one of
them, it shall be lawful for the constable, and the residue of
the said <i>Twelve</i>, or for the most part of them, to choose
in supply such other of the said town, as by them, or the more
part of them, shall be thought meet, provided that such choice <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>shall be
always ratified and allowed by the stewards of the lords of the
said town, or by such one of them as shall happen to keep court
in the said town, next after such choice made, or otherwise the
same choice to be void: and if such choice shall by the said
stewards, or by such one of them as shall fortune to be present
as aforesaid, be disallowed, until a sufficient man, in the
judgment of the said stewards, be
chosen.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; If any man hath
heretofore built, erected, or set up any wall, shed, or any such
like thing whatsoever, to the annoyance of the market place, or
of the block house there, and shall not, upon warning given him
by the constable, or his deputy for the time being, pull down or
remove away the same within ten days after such warning given,
that then he shall forfeit five pounds, and be further punished
by discretion of the
commissioners.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; Forasmuch,
as the town is overcharged with the multitude of poor people,
which daily are thought to increase by means of receiving
under-tenants, lodging of strangers, and the disorder of
tippling-houses, and that the constable cannot, without further
assistance, take upon him the whole oversight and charge of all
the parts of the town in this behalf, it is thought meet that
every one of the <i>Twelve</i> shall have assigned upon him some
street or circuit near his dwelling-house, where he shall, as
deputy to the constable, have special charge for the keeping of
good order; and especially to see that the order for the
avoidance of under tenants, be duly observed; and that none lodge
or keep tippling houses.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
All the acts, receipts, reprises, and charges and accounts of the
town, shall, from time to time, as they are had, made, and done,
be entered into a register book by the clerk for that purpose, by
the constable, vicar, and churchwardens for the time being, to be
chosen.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; The master and
owner, or one of them, of every boat, in every voyage, at every
sharing and account, without further delay, shall deliver up into
the custody of the churchwardens, or one of them, or of one or
more indifferently to be deputed or appointed by the said vicar,
and churchwardens, the said half-share and quarter-share, without
diminution or retention thereof, to be by the said wardens, or
him or them so deputed, safely kept until <i>St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Day</i> yearly then next following, to the use, for the
half-share, of the vicar, and for the quarter-share, to the use
of the town, upon pain for every owner and master for not
delivering up as is aforesaid, to forfeit for every time forty
shillings, and to be further punished by the discretion of the
commissioners.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>And whereas</i> there hath
been a controversy of long time between the said fishermen, being
the greater part of the parish, and the husbandmen and artificers
there, as well for that of the reparations of the church, as all
other public charges, which hath been great, as building of forts
and walls, provision of shot and powder, and other necessaries
for the defence of the town against foreign enemies, have been
sustained and borne by the said quarter share of the said
fishermen only (except a small annuity or yearly rent of two
windmills, whereof one is now utterly decayed); as well for the
utter extinguishment of all such controversy and division, as
also for the better increase of amity and neighbourly friendship
among the said parties, the said Lord <i>Buckhurst</i> and
Richard <i>Shelley</i>, Esquire, have likewise caused to be set
down here in writing at the place, and in the day and year
aforesaid, the names of all such husbandmen and artificers which
are of ability within the said town, and the several sums of
money which every of them, by their several consents, have
granted yearly to be paid for, and in name of a contribution
towards the charges aforesaid.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rate of the
husbandmen and artificers yearly to be paid on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Day, to the churchwardens, towards the
reparations of the church, and other public charges of the town.
* * * * * * There are also in the said town of Brighthelmston, of
fishing boats four score in number, and of able mariners four
hundred in number, with ten thousand fishing nets, besides many
other necessaries belonging to their mystery, all which being
matters of great charge, require very great maintenance and
reparation, and are like <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>hereafter rather to decay than to
increase, by reason the said fishermen are diversly charged and
burdened with service of her majesty in sizes, sessions, and
other courts and other services, and with musters and setting
forth of soldiers, besides their service by sea, properly
appertaining unto them, and especially by reason of the great
scarcity and dearth of timber and wood now of late years, by
means of iron furnaces placed near the Downs, risen from three
shillings and four pence a ton, to thirteen shillings and four
pence; from two shillings and sixpence a load of wood to seven
shillings; and from six shillings and eight pence a load of coal
to fourteen shillings; and of billet or tall wood, from two
shillings and sixpence the hundred to eight shillings the
hundred; and ship board from fifteen shillings the hundred to
forty shillings the
hundred.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; If any owner or
lessor of any house within <i>Brighthelmston</i>, shall admit any
tenant or tenants, under tenant or under tenants, into his said
house, except the said tenant or tenants shall, by the opinion of
the constable and the churchwardens in writing first to be set
down, be thought of sufficient ability to maintain himself and
his family without burdening the town, then the said owner or
lessor shall forfeit for every month that any such tenant, not
being estimated as aforesaid, shall inhabit or dwell in his said
house, to the poor man&rsquo;s box, three shillings and four
pence.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; If any questions,
doubt, or ambiguity, shall hereafter happen to arise about any of
the said orders, or the pains therein contained, then the same to
be expounded and interpreted by the said commissioners, or any of
them.</p>

<p>It is conjectured by some antiquarians that the above marks
are symbols of the trade or occupation of those who assented to
the foregoing recited orders; their opinion being formed from the
circumstance of Stoneham, the constable, being a ship carpenter,
and attaching a hatchet to his name; and for the same reason the
supposition is that Oston, from his sign was a butcher, Good, a
wheelwright, <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>and Mellershe a millwright.&nbsp; The rest seem wholly
unintelligible.</p>
<p>In the year 1580, Lord <i>Buckhurst</i> and Mr. <i>Shelley</i>
made a new order concerning the penalty falling on the owner or
lessor of any house let without the written consent of the
constable and churchwardens, which was henceforth to be levied
from the under-tenant, as well as from the said owner or
lessee.</p>
<p>And in the year 1592, they made another order, which subjected
absentees, who owned houses or any other tenements within the
parish, to contribute to the public charges of the said parish,
in proportion to their possessions there, as if they were
residents.&nbsp; In case of contumacious resistance or neglect of
the said orders, the constable, or his deputy, and the
churchwardens, or any two of them, of which the constable or his
deputy being one, were authorised by the above-named
commissioners, to imprison such as offended in that particular
until they shall be contented to observe and keep the same.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that this commission terminated with the
life of Lord Buckhurst, who died in 1608; for we find the
inhabitants of <i>Brighthelmston</i>, in ten years after,
revising and ratifying &ldquo;the ancient customs heretofore used
among and between the fishermen and landsmen&rdquo; there,
&ldquo;and orders out of the said customs taken and made,&rdquo;
without the authority or interference of any superior; and as
these customs must be materially directive of the internal polity
of the town even at this day, the following copy of them, with a
few comments on their immediate relevancy to the present
parochial constitution of Brighthelmston, will not be
unacceptable to many readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Upon <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> agreement made by
and between the ancient fishermen and landmen of the town of
Brighthelmston, in the county of Sussex, the second day of
February, 1618, for remedy and redress of certain disorders in
their said town, as also for the better increase of brotherly
love and amity for ever hereafter between the said fishermen and
landmen, and for the annual payment of certain money called a
<i>quarter of a share</i>, heretofore of ancient time usually
paid out of every boat in every fishing voyage, to the
churchwardens there, towards the maintenance of the church and
other public charges about the necessary defence of the town; and
of a certain contribution by the rest of the inhabitants, being
landmen, towards the bearing of the said charges, to be had and
levied; and for the purposes aforesaid the said fishermen and
landmen, having met and assembled together, here have set down in
writing <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>their ancient customs and orders concerning the true
making, paying, and employing the said quarter share; and also of
the paying and employing of the said landmen&rsquo;s
contribution, or yearly rate for the uses aforesaid, and for the
certainty and true payment thereof in manner and form hereafter
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Ancient Custom for Payment and Employing the</i>
<span class="smcap">Quarter
Share</span>.&mdash;<i>Imprimis</i>.&nbsp; It is concluded and
agreed between the said fishermen and landmen, the day and year
above mentioned, that they, the said fishermen, shall yearly make
as they have done time out of mind, a quarter of a share out of
every fishing boat in every fishing voyage; and the same so being
made, shall yearly and every year pay, at the end of every
voyage, unto the fishermen churchwardens for the time being,
without diminution or deduction, the said quarter share, to be by
them and the other churchwarden, kept and employed unto the only
and proper use of the town in the common town box, until the new
constable shall be chosen
yearly.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; It is agreed
between the said landmen and fishermen above said, that the said
landmen shall yearly and every year pay and bring unto the said
common town-box, in or upon the second day of February, commonly
called <i>Candlemas Day</i>, yearly, half so much money <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> as the aforesaid quarter share shall
amount unto; there to be by all the said churchwardens kept and
employed unto the general and public use of the
town.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; It is further
concluded and agreed upon between the said fishermen and the said
landmen, that all manner of town charges whatsoever (the
king&rsquo;s composition or customary wheat only excepted) shall
be taken out of the common town box, whether it be for the
maintenance of the church, the communion bread and wine, the
maintenance of the lecture, the clerk and sexton&rsquo;s wages,
the lights in the fire cage, the paying the king&rsquo;s
majesty&rsquo;s oats and coals, and the setting forth of soldiers
or sailors, and all manner of other necessary and public town
charge shall be taken out of the said common town box, by and
with the consent of the constable and churchwardens for the time
being, and six other, whereof <i>four</i> to be of the sea, two
of the land.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; It is further
ordered by and between the said fishermen and landmen, that if it
shall happen that the said quarter share and the land
contribution will not at any time amount and countervail the
whole charge that shall arise and grow by reason of any
extraordinary charge happening, that then the constable and
churchwardens, and six other of the said inhabitants shall tax,
rate, and cess all the said inhabitants proportionably, every one
according to their estate and
ability.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; It is also agreed
between the said fishermen and landmen that the churchwardens,
every year, shall collect and gather and bring in unto the common
town-box the said quarter share, and the warders for sea causes
to collect and gather it; and the land-warden being with one of
the sea-wardens shall also yearly, and every year, bring into the
said common town-box the rate or taxation of the other
inhabitants not being fishermen; which rate or taxation every
year ought to amount to half so much as the said quarter of a
share doth yearly; and also shall gather, receive, and take up
all rents and other land profits belonging to the town, as the
rent of the town-house, town mills, and Bartholomews, which,
being so received, shall yearly bring into the said town box,
there to be kept up to the general use of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Orders concerning the</i> <span
class="smcap">Constable</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
It is further agreed between the said fishermen and landmen, that
the constable of the said town shall yearly have for and towards
his labour and pains taken in that behalf, and for and towards
his charges and expenses, the sum of twenty-five shillings, eight
pence, of lawful money of <i>England</i>, to be paid unto him out
of the said common town-box, and also that every constable,
whether he be a landman or a fisherman, shall yearly have, and
quietly enjoy, to his own use, without any let, molestation, or
trouble, one horse lease.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
It is also ordered between the said fishermen and the said
landmen, <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>that the two headboroughs of the said town, shall have
yearly for their pains and troubles in their office, the sum of
five shillings, eight pence, a-piece, to be paid unto them out of
the said common town-box; and also shall have and quietly enjoy
to their own use, one cow lease, and twenty-five sheep leases,
according to the ancient
custom.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; It is also
ordered, that there shall be selected and chosen out of the said
ancientest, gravest, and wisest inhabitants, eight fishermen and
four landmen, for assistants to the constable in every public
cause, whereof every one shall be ready to give his attendance
upon the constable as often as need shall require: and whosoever
shall presume to call together any assembly to the intent to
practice or put in use any manner of device or act touching the
government of the said town, without the privilege, consent, and
commandment of the said constable and assistants, shall forfeit
for every time so doing, forty shillings: and to the intent that
the choice of the said <i>twelve</i> grave and wise men, may have
a continuance, therefore, upon the death or removing of any one
of the said <i>Twelve</i>, or of the most part of them, to choose
in supply such other of the said town as by them, or the most
part of them, shall be thought meet, provided always that such
choice shall be always ratified and allowed by the stewards of
the lords of the said town, at the law day when the constable is
chosen, or by such one of them as shall happen to keep such court
in the said town, or otherwise the said choice to be void: and if
every such choice shall be by the said stewards, or by such one
of them as shall fortune to be present as aforesaid, be
disallowed, until a sufficient man or such sufficient men, shall
be, in the judgment of the same steward, elected and
chosen.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; For as much as the
town is overcharged with the multitude of poor people, which
daily are thought to increase by means of receiving under
tenants, lodging and harbouring of strangers, and the great
disorder of tippling-houses; and that the constable cannot
without further assistance, take upon himself the whole oversight
and charge of all the parts of the town; in this behalf, it is
thought meet that every one of the said <i>Twelve</i> shall have
assigned unto him some place, street, or circuit of the said
town, near about his dwelling house, where he shall, as deputy to
the constable, have special charge for the keeping of good order;
and especially to see that the order for the avoiding under
tenants be duly observed and kept; and that none lodge or keep
tippling without license.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For as much as the said inhabitants of the said town of
<i>Brighthelmston</i>, hath of long time, and yet still are to
the making hereof, been over-charged and suppressed by the
multitude of poor people, which daily are thought to increase by
the means of many ale-house keepers and victuallers which do
harbour and receive all comers and goers, to the great hurt and
hinderance of the said inhabitants, and doth still sell and keep
ale and beer without license, and against the said
inhabitants&rsquo; consent, it is now ordered by the said
inhabitants, for the suppressing of the said number of ale-houses
and victualling-houses, that from henceforth for ever hereafter
none of the said inhabitants whatsoever shall at any time
hereafter, draw, sell, or keep any victualling or ale-house
within the said town without a letter or testimonial of the said
inhabitants, in writing, first had and obtained, by and with the
consent of the constable, vicar, or curate, and six other
substantial men of the said inhabitants, whereof four to be of
the seamen, and two of the landmen in their behalf, to be made
unto the Justices of the King&rsquo;s Majesty&rsquo;s Peace,
whereby they, and so many of them, and not more, may be lawfully
licensed to use the said trade of victualling and ale-house
keeping; and also that such a competent number may be by the said
Justices of the King&rsquo;s Majesty&rsquo;s Peace (whereof one
to be of the quorum), and by and with the consent of the said
inhabitants, nominated and appointed: and that none other of the
said inhabitants may use or occupy the said trade of victualling
or ale-house keeping in the said town, but so many of them as
shall be lawfully licensed as is aforesaid, upon pain and peril
of every one so doing contrary to the true meaning of this
present order, to forfeit for every barrel of beer so drawn, six
shillings and eight pence.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
If any man <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>hath heretofore builded, erected, or set up any house,
wall, pale, shed, or any such like thing whatever; or if any
hereafter shall erect, build, or set up any house, wall, shed,
pale, or any such like thing whatsoever, to the annoyance of the
market-place, or of the block-house there, and shall not, upon
warning given him by the constable, or his deputy for the time
being, pull down or remove away the same within ten days after
such warning given, that then he shall forfeit the sum of five
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Orders for Payment of the</i> <span
class="smcap">Quarter Share</span>.&mdash;These being almost
literally the same as those presented to, and ratified by, Lord
<i>Buckhurst</i> and Mr Shelley, in 1580, are purposely omitted;
as are also, for the same reason, the Orders for the <span
class="smcap">Length of Nets</span> in this second book of
Customs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Orders concerning the</i> <span
class="smcap">Landmen</span>.&mdash;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; It is
ordered, that the constable and churchwardens of
<i>Brighthelmston</i> for the time being, with two or three of
the substantial landmen, shall yearly cess, tax, and rate towards
the common charge of the town, as well all the landmen,
husbandmen, and artificers, and all of the inhabitants having
land there; and also all such persons as have lands, tenements,
or other yearly profits by land, in the said town, and dwell in
other places, according to the quantity of their lands,
tenements, and profits, proportionably with the said inhabitants;
the which cessment, rate, or taxation, shall be yearly made and
set down in writing, under the hands of the said constable,
churchwardens, and substantial landmen, before the feast day of
<i>Epiphany</i>, and shall amount unto half as much as the
quarter share shall come unto yearly: and further it is ordered,
that such persons as dwell in other places, and have in their own
occupation within the said town, lands, tenements, or other
yearly profits, shall likewise yearly pay all such sums of money
as they, and every of them, in manner and form aforesaid, shall
be rated and taxed, upon pain of such forfeitures and punishments
as are to be inflicted on the inhabitants of the said town, for
not paying such sums of money as they, in like sort, shall be
cessed, taxed, or rated.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
Whosoever, being a landman, husbandman, artificer, or inhabitant,
or every other occupier of land or tenements of and in the said
town, that shall not yearly, before the feast day of the
<i>Purification of St. Mary</i>, pay unto the Churchwardens for
the time being, all such sum or sums of money as he or they shall
be cessed, rated or taxed, shall for every time so doing, forfeit
the double value thereof.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp;
If any owner or lessee of any house in Brighthelmston, admit any
tenant or tenants, under-tenant or under-tenants, into his said
house, except the said tenant or tenants shall, by the opinion of
the constable and the churchwardens in writing first to be set
down, be thought of sufficient ability to maintain himself and
his family without burdening the town, then the owner and lessee
shall, for every month that any such tenant, not being estimated
as aforesaid, shall inhabit or dwell in his house, to forfeit
unto the use of the poor of the said town, ten
shillings.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>.&nbsp; That whereas it
is before ordered, that the owner and lessee of any house in
<i>Brighthelmston</i>, in case he admitted any under-tenant,
without the consent of the constable and churchwardens, first had
in writing, shall forfeit monthly during the abode or inhabiting
of any such under-tenant not being approved as aforesaid,
<i>monthly</i>, ten shillings.&nbsp; Now forasmuch as the said
penalties cannot conveniently be levied of such owners as are not
resident or abiding within the town, and that the town is more
burdened and charged with poor than heretofore it hath been, it
is now further ordered, that the penalties for every default
contrary to the said order, shall be extended in all points as
well against the under-tenants, as against the said lessee or
owner.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The orders for the churchwardens in this town book,
being in substance the same with those before transcribed from
the former, they need not hero be repeated.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&ldquo;The immemorial existence of the above customs in
the town of Brighthelmston, is incontestible even at this day:
and though some of them be now obsolete on account of the great
changes which the town has experienced during the present
century, no part of its existing polity can legally run counter
to those ancient customs, except upon sanction of an Act of
Parliament, or where the right of exercising them has been
evidently given up.&nbsp; The commissioners in 1580, only
investigated and affixed publicity and order to those customs:
and their subsequent orders to the inhabitants, were no more than
what a bench of justices may issue at the present day.&nbsp; The
independent style of the ancient fishermen and landmen in the
second book, seems to be that of men who were conscious of a
prescriptive right of legislation in certain matters within their
own parish: and the Saxon constitution, whose equitable and
benign spirit still feebly pervades what we now call the British
Constitution, granted the same right to every parish all over
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The custom of choosing three churchwardens annually is
still exercised, though the cause of it has ceased to exist for
more than half a century past.&nbsp; But the customary existence
of twelve assistants and advisers to the constable has ceased,
though the occasion for which they were first instituted still
remains, nay, increases commensurately with the population of the
town.&nbsp; The ancient society of the twelve shall therefore be
revived.&nbsp; That such a society did once exist, by custom,
cannot be denied: and the mere neglect of a custom for ever so
many years is no deseasance of the right to exercise it at any
subsequent period.&nbsp; But its revival shall not be for the
creation or benefit of a party.&nbsp; Political equality is the
birth-right of every Briton; and no civil power can be lawful
which emanated not originally from the assent of society, and is
invariably exercised for the public good.&nbsp; The Twelve
therefore shall be chosen by ballot at a public meeting of all
the inhabitants, and every future vacancy in that body filled by
public election in the same manner.&nbsp; The gentleman who
presides at present at the court leet of the town, there is every
reason to suppose, would cheerfully ratify so respectable an
election; and the police of so populous a parish would, in
future, be managed with signal <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>vigilance, under the inspection of
twelve chosen guardians of the public peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the discontinuance of the ancient society of the
Twelve, that made it necessary to appoint commissioners by act of
Parliament, in the year 1772, for lighting and cleaning the
streets, lanes, and other places within the town of
Brighthelmston; as also for removing and preventing nuisances,
holding and regulating a daily market there, and building and
repairing groynes, in order to render the coast more safe and
commodious for vessels to unload and land sea-coal, culm, and
other coal, for the use of the town: and in order to enable the
said commissioners to accomplish these public and serviceable
ends, they are allowed by the act, a duty of sixpence on every
chaldron of coal or culm so landed.&nbsp; As it is not unlikely a
question may hereafter arise concerning the precincts of the
commissioners&rsquo; power, it may not here be unseasonable to
consider how far it extends.&nbsp; As the letter of the act seems
to confine it to the limits of the town, the sagacity of
litigation may discover that the buildings erected since the year
1772, in the then common fields and environs of Brighthelmston,
could not have been in contemplation of the framers of the act,
inasmuch as those buildings were not then <i>in esse</i>.&nbsp;
But as there never were any fixed boundaries to the town, as far
as continuous buildings and population reach within the parish,
so far, I conceive, shall the town, and consequently the power of
the commissioners, be admitted always to extend.&nbsp; Otherwise,
indeed, the act would be abortive and absurd.&nbsp; These
commissioners were originally sixty-four in number, and
constituted of the most respectable inhabitants in the
town.&nbsp; Many vacancies by death and removal, have since
occurred, and been very properly filled by election among the
existing members.&nbsp; Yet I am so fully assured of the evil
tendency in general, as well as the injustice of political
monopoly of every kind, that I regret the right of election on
those occasions had not vested in the inhabitants at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as the authority of the commissioners exceeds not,
except in a few particulars, that of parochial surveyors, the
Society of Twelve, if called forth again into existence and
exertion, would be of great benefit to the town.&nbsp; In summer,
Brighthelmston too frequently becomes the chief receptacle of the
vice and dissipation <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>which the sickening metropolis
disgorges into our watering places at this season.&nbsp; Its
population then is upwards of ten thousand, and only one
constable and two headboroughs to preserve the order and safety
of the town amidst such a medley.&nbsp; Were there twelve more of
the most active and intelligent inhabitants of the town, united
with them in directing and strengthening its police, the careful
parent would then have less reason to fear the gambler for his
son, or the debauchee for his daughter.&nbsp; The constable of
Brighthelmston had such a society to assist him when it was but
an obscure fishing town: the propriety of reviving the same, at
this period of its popularity and splendour, I leave every
thinking inhabitant of the place to consider and
enforce.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dunvan</i>, 1795.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> VII.<br />
THE TENANTRY LANDS.</h2>
<p>Upon the general survey made throughout England, by order of
King Alfred, the tenantry land of Brighthelmston, was, like the
estates in general, in other parishes of the kingdom, planned and
plotted out; and from time to time, down to the present date, the
possessions of the different land-owners, have, from various
changes in the proprietorship, been re-measured and set out; and
such a procedure is termed taking the terrier.&nbsp; Dooms-day
Book has it: <i>Statutum de admensuratione terrarum</i>.&nbsp;
Dooms-day Book is a book that was made by order of William the
Conqueror, in which all the estates of the kingdom are
registered.&nbsp; It consists of two volumes, which are deposited
at Westminster, in the chapter-house; where they may be consulted
on paying the fee of 6s. 8d. for a search, and 4d per line for a
transcript.&nbsp; It was begun in 1081, and not completed till
1087.&nbsp; There is a copy of it in the library of the dean and
chapter of Exeter.&nbsp; One leaf of it was discovered some years
since at Nettlecombe, in Somersetshire, a seat of Sir John
Trevelyan, Bart, who sent it to the dean and chapter.&nbsp; There
is a story extant in connexion with finding this leaf.&nbsp; In a
room at Nettlecombe, <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>which was used as a depository for
lumber, and furniture and goods not in general use, a square of
glass in the window always remained broken; and notwithstanding,
from time to time, the window was repaired, the next morning, not
only was the glass found to be demolished, but, invariably, three
drops of blood stained the sash.&nbsp; It happened on one
occasion when the deeds of the estate had to be referred to by
the solicitor of the family, Mr. Leigh, that the remarkable
incident of the window was mentioned to him; as the family
parchments and papers were actually deposited in a strong chest
in that very room.&nbsp; Being a person of a superstitious turn
of mind, and of antiquarian research, he conceived the idea that
amongst the accumulation of musty deeds, there was one which
would give the solution to the strange mystery.&nbsp; A general
overhauling therefore, of the contents of the old oak chest was
made; but nothing of any moment was discovered, save a dingy leaf
of some book, which seemed to have no connection whatever with
the rest of the papers.&nbsp; This proved to be the long lost and
frequently sought for leaf of the Exeter Dooms-day Book.&nbsp;
The story continues, that the square of glass was that day
repaired; and the next morning not only was it found to be
broken, with the three drops of blood sprinkled on the sash, but
upon the lid of the old oak chest, having filled its mission, lay
dead a pure white dove.&nbsp; Ever after the restored window
remained uninjured.&nbsp; On the 3rd day of March, 1738, was
made:&mdash;&ldquo;A General Terrier of the several Lands lyeing
and being in the Common Laines of Brighthelmston, in the County
of Sussex, shewing each person&rsquo;s quantity in Pauls, Eight
of which make an Acre; made and agreed unto by several owners and
occupiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The several Laines are: West Laine, Little Laine, East Laine,
Hilly Laine, and North Laine.&nbsp; There are besides, portions
called White Hawk, and Church Hill.&nbsp; The Laines are set out
in measured areas, termed furlongs, <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a> which furlongs are
subdivided into irregular portions called paul-pieces,
&ldquo;eight of which make an acre,&rdquo; the tenantry acres
varying considerably as to the number of rods they contain,
ranging from 35 to 210 rods.&nbsp; Some of these <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>have other
pauls running into them; and in such instances, from the shape
they thus assume, they are termed &ldquo;hatchet pieces;&rdquo;
while the extreme pauls of the furlongs in the Laines, are called
&ldquo;headlands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Terrier at present used in defining property in the
parish, is the &ldquo;Terrier to the tenantry land in the parish
of Brighthelmston, as it was measured and set out in the year
MDCCXCII, by Thomas Budgen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Copies of the Terriers,
in a book form, are in the hands of several of the solicitors and
surveyors in the town, and the proprietors of the tenantry
lands.&nbsp; The most concise plan is a map of the whole parish,
with elaborate references.&nbsp; For the convenience of
cultivation, a Terrier was taken, agreeable to a resolution
passed by the principal landholders, at a meeting which was held
at the Old Ship, on the 26th day of March, 1776, that by drawing
lots the owners of several pauls in different parts of a furlong,
might have their lands together in one piece in each
furlong.&nbsp; The arrangement did not in the least alter the
proprietorship of the several pauls.</p>
<p>The following is the whole content of the Parish, as taken by

<p>In the &ldquo;Nonarum Inquisitiones&rdquo; is the following
descriptive valuation of Brighthelmston:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This indenture testifies that an
acquisition was taken before Henry Husse and fellows, collectors,
and assessors of the ix<i>th</i> of garbel fleeces and lambs, and
of the xv<i>th</i> granted to our lord the king, in the county of
Sussex, assigned at Lewes, on a Sunday, in the middle of the
xl<i>th</i> year of the reign of King Edward the Third, from the
nonal inquest, and the quindecimal concerning the true value of
the ix<i>th</i> of garbel, (corn) ix<i>th</i> of fleeces, and
ix<i>th</i> of lambs, by commission of our lord the king,
directed to the aforesaid Henry and his fellows, by the oath of
John de Erlee, Hugh Russell, John Dac&rsquo;, and Ralph Grabb,
parishioners of Brighthelmston&mdash;who say, that the extent of
the church there is taxed at xxv pounds with the vicarage.&nbsp;
And they say that the ix<i>th</i> part of garbel is worth this
year, there, ix pounds, viii shillings, and x pence from the
community of the town.&nbsp; Also the ix<i>th</i> part of fleeces
there is worth xxvi shillings and vi pence, and the ix<i>th</i>
part of lambs there, is worth vi shillings and viii pence.&nbsp;
Also they say, that the ix<i>th</i> part of garbel and fleeces of
the prior or Lewes there, is worth, vii shillings and viii
pence.&nbsp; Also the ix<i>th</i> part of garbel and fleeces of
the prior of Michelham, is worth xxx shillings and iv
pence.&nbsp; And so is the sum of the whole ix<i>th</i> of
garbel, fleeces, and lambs, this year, xiii pounds.&nbsp; Also
they say that the ix<i>th</i> part aforesaid cannot answer nor
attain to the taxation of the church aforesaid; for that xl acres
of land are drowned by the sea for ever, which were worth per
annum xl shillings.&nbsp; And also clx acres of land in the
common plain, which have been deficient there this year in corn
sown, to the <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>value of x pounds.&nbsp; And because the wool cannot be
sold as it was wont, the value of xiii shillings and iv pence is
deficient.&nbsp; And also the lambs there will be deficient in
the pasture this year, by defect of value vi shillings and viii
pence.&nbsp; And the vicar has there the first-prints of one
dove-house, value ii shillings.&nbsp; And the same has there in
offerings, small tithes of geese, sucking pigs, honey, milk,
cheese, calves, and eggs, and other small tithes which are worth
yearly lxx shillings.&nbsp; Also they say, that there are here no
merchants, but tenants of land who live by their own lands, and
their great labours only.&nbsp; In testimony of which thing, the
aforesaid sworn men have affixed their seals to this
indenture.&rdquo;</p>

THE BARTHOLOMEWS.</h2>
<p>The chauntry, or free chapel, dedicated to St. Bartholomew,
was erected on a piece of land granted by the lord of the manor
of Brighthelmston, to the Priory of St. Pancras, at Southover,
Lewes, under a quit rent of 3d a-year.&nbsp; It was built to the
south-west of the knappe or knab, originally called by the Saxon
settlers, <i>cn&aelig;p</i>, (the summit or crown of a hill) from
its elevated position.&nbsp; It is now generally known by the
name of Brighton place.&nbsp; Attached to the chauntry was a
dwelling for the two or three monks who officiated there.&nbsp;
The chauntry was destroyed by the fire which devastated the town,
on the landing of the French, under Primauget, and it never after
recovered its accustomed use and influence.&nbsp; The almshouses,
which were afterwards built on the site, were sold to the parish
in 1733, for the sum of &pound;17, and the dwelling of the monks,
called the Prior&rsquo;s Lodge, became the residence of the vicar
of Brighthelmston, after the Reformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magna Britannia&rdquo; mentions, &ldquo;that there was
a church near the middle of the town, and it was burnt down some
years ago by the French.&rdquo;&nbsp; This probably refers to the
chapel or chauntry of St. Bartholomew.&nbsp; The Prior&rsquo;s
Lodge was pulled down by the Rev. Thomas Hudson, in 1790, the
year he was collated to the rectory of Blatchington and vicarage
of Brighthelmston.&nbsp; From the style of the architecture, and
the decayed state of the timbers, there was ample room for
supposing the building to have been erected not later than the
close of the thirteenth century.&nbsp; In 1665 the Bartholomews
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>is
mentioned as a parcel of pasture.&nbsp; The parish workhouse,
demolished in 1823, was erected on its site, and the rest of the
space continued nearly plain ground till, in 1774, the market
place was built, where the present Town Hall stands.&nbsp; The
original market-place, that possessed by the town under the
charter of Edward II., was on the cliff, where it had continued
from the year 1313 till the close of the seventeenth, or the
beginning of the last century; when, that part being sapped by
the waves, the building was demolished.&nbsp; The vicarage house,
which was substituted for the Prior&rsquo;s Lodge, by the Rev. T.
Hudson, was vacated by the present vicar, the Rev. Henry Michell
Wagner, in 1835, and pulled down in 1837.&nbsp; The old vicarage
garden was about a quarter of an acre in extent.</p>
<p>The first stone of the present vicarage was laid on the 24th
day of June, 1834, and in the following year the structure was
completed, and accepted by the Bishop of the Diocese, on the
unanimous recommendation of six commissioners, namely, three
laymen and three clergymen, to the effect that the exchange would
be, in every respect, beneficial.&nbsp; It stands in a garden of
exactly two measured acres; and was built by Messrs. George
Cheesman and Son.</p>
<p>In 1584, William Midwinter, a sailor, sold the site of the
chauntry to Thomas Friend and others, in trust for the said town,
in consideration of the sum of &pound;44, which had been raised
by subscription among the inhabitants.&nbsp; It had been granted
to Lord Cromwell, on the dissolution of the Priory of Lewes; and
on his attainder and execution, to Anne of Cleves.&nbsp; It
reverted to the Crown in 1557, after the death of that Princess,
and afterwards came into the possession of Roger Blackbourne, a
farmer of Yorkshire.&nbsp; In 1577 he aliened it to Milo Taylor,
servant to Lord Buckhurst, and John Codwell, both of Southover,
Lewes.&nbsp; Taylor soon after released his share to Codwell, who
sold the whole to Midwinter.</p>
<p>In 1773, an Act of Parliament was obtained for erecting and
holding a daily market, Sundays excepted; and the waste land of
the Bartholomews being a central situation, and the common
property of the town, it was fixed on for the site of the said
market.&nbsp; <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>The workmen, who were employed in digging for the
foundation of this building, happened to cut through a little
cemetery, which seems to have belonged to the chauntry of St.
Bartholomew, and were so strongly impressed with superstitious
awe, by the bones which they uncovered, that they refused to
proceed with their work.&nbsp; The vicar, the Rev. Henry Michell,
being informed of their scruples, came to the spot, and instead
of exerting his personal influence, which was very great over all
classes of his parishioners, or vainly combating the prejudices
of ignorance with reason, applauded their veneration for the
supposed remains of Christians, but assured them that all who had
ever been interred there were rank Papists.&nbsp; Their first
prejudice being thus laid by a stronger, the men resumed their
work, and turned over the rest of the bones with the apathy of
grave-diggers.</p>
<p>About fifty years since, in one of the old tumble-down houses
which occupied the site whereon now stand the Schools of Mr.
Henry Catt, by the &ldquo;Knab Pump,&rdquo; resided Thomas
Herbert, a short, stout, fat, and greasy old fellow, possessing
but one eye, who professed to make the best sausages out of
Germany.&nbsp; He was a maker of small meat pies and sausages;
and with these he exhibited his &ldquo;Publications for
Sale.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the author of the play, &ldquo;Too much
the Way of the World,&rdquo; and likewise of &ldquo;A Brief
Sketch of Human Life;&rdquo; which, with his other literary
works, lay cheek by jowl with his comestibles.&nbsp; He had been
a butcher; and the following specimen of his literary talent,
written in a bold hand, in his window, expressed the cause of the
change in his occupation; as he stated he was one</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who, for want of cash, the shambles
spurn&rsquo;d,<br />
And is for once a play-wright turn&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> IX.<br />
THE WORKHOUSE.</h2>
<p>From the deepest research which the compiler of this work has
been able to make, he cannot find that any Workhouse existed in
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Brighton
prior to 1727, in which year the following entries appear in the
Town book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>February 26th, 1727,&mdash;That a mortgage be
effected on the workhouse, to indemnify Thomas Simmons, in paying
the moneys he made of the materialls of Blockhouse, to the
constable and churchwardens; by them to be disbursed in payment
of materialls and the workmen employed about building the
workhouse.</p>
<p>May 10th,&mdash;Order in Vestry for Churchwardens and
Overseers,&mdash;with all speed to borrow &pound;50, to pay for
materials and workmanship about the Workhouse, in the building of
it, to be repaid out of the poor rate, or taxes to be raised in
the parish, on or before the 10th of May, 1728.</p>
<p>At a public vestry meeting, held at the Old Ship, October
18th, 1727, it is agreed that the Churchwardens and Overseers
shall take up with all convenient speed, and borrow one hundred
pounds, upon interest at 5 per centum per annum, towards building
the new workhouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amongst the minutes of the public vestry, 13th November, 1727,
there is the entry of a contract being entered into, between the
parish and Thomas Fletcher and Thomas Tuppen, for digging and
steining the well to the new workhouse, complete, with fittings,
for ten guineas.</p>
<p>The Workhouse at this period was evidently of very limited
extent.&nbsp; But in 1733 a portion of the Almshouses in
connexion with the chauntry of St. Bartholomew was added to the
building.&nbsp; The spot is now occupied by the east end of the
Brighton Market.&nbsp; A tenement for the poor previously existed
in East street; and in 1690, in consequence of the great increase
of the poor-rates, on account of the inroads of the sea, and the
injury experienced by the town from the civil and foreign wars of
that and the preceding century, by order of the Justices at the
quarter Sessions, at Lewes, the following parishes, that had no
poor of their own, were called upon to make the following
contributions:&mdash;</p>

54</span>Formerly the recipients of parish relief were compelled
to wear an insignia of their pauperism; as in a vestry minute
appears the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>At a monthly meeting of the Churchwardens and
Overseers, held 27th August, 1698, an accompt was given that
Susan Stone, the widdow of Thomas, refused to ware the Town
badge, (viz<sup>t.</sup>) the letters, (B: P:) upon which she was
putt out of the weekly pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present Workhouse, on Church Hill, was commenced in 1820,
Mr. William Mackie, Architect, Charlotte street,
Blackfriars&rsquo; road, London, furnishing the design, which was
selected from forty others by the Directors and Guardians, who
had advertised a premium for the best design; as it was then
considered it combined a proper degree of elegance with economy,
and was replete with more convenience than any other institution
for the same purpose in the kingdom.&nbsp; Great alterations and
additions have been made to the original building, according to
the fancy or caprice of the boards of Guardians for the time
being.&nbsp; Mr. John Cheesman was the builder.&nbsp; The
ceremony of laying the foundation stone was not of the imposing
character which is assumed on commencing similar public buildings
in modern times.&nbsp; The stone was merely one that had been dug
up while getting out the ground for the foundation of the house;
and was of the rudest shape, about two feet in length, eighteen
inches in width, and ten inches in depth.&nbsp; It was laid by
the Vicar, the Rev. Dr. Carr, afterwards Bishop of Chichester,
and subsequently of Worcester.</p>
<p>Brighton, at that time, had a population of 24,000, and there
were about 4,000 inhabited houses.&nbsp; Fields surrounded the
Workhouse grounds; that to the south, the detached grave-yard of
the Old Church, being used for occasional festivities, and for
the practice of the Royal Artillery.&nbsp; The first building
erected near the House was a soap manufactory, by a Mr.
Heard.&nbsp; The premises are now the residence and establishment
of Dr. Foreman.&nbsp; On the failure of the soap works, which
were to astonish the good people of <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Brighton, Mr. Airey converted the
building into school premises, and for a few years had a good
school there,&mdash;the Church hill Grammar School.&nbsp; The
Rev. Dr. Butler succeeded him, and then, for a short time, the
Rev. Mr. Pugh carried on the establishment.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorncroft was the first person who took up his abode in
the new Workhouse, which had a tablet over the main entrance,
thus inscribed:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Brighthelmston
Poor-House,<br />
Erected A.D., 1821.<br />
Vicar, Rev. R. J. Carr, D.D.<br />
Churchwardens: Edward Blaker / Robert Ackerson / Richard
Bodle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the old Workhouse, or rather Poor-house as it was called,
the average number of inmates was 150, and the only labour
consisted in collecting and crushing oyster-shells in a large
iron mortar.&nbsp; This work was done by the able-bodied out-door
poor, in the winter months, at a fixed price per bushel.&nbsp;
The material thus produced was sold for manuring land, and for
constructing paths in parks, lawns, &amp;c.&nbsp; The Governor at
that time, was Mr. Hayward, he having succeeded Mr. Bailey, and
the inmates were farmed to Mr. Rice, at a contract price for
their board, of about 4s a-week per head.&nbsp; Previous to Mr.
Bailey, Mr. Sicklemore was the Governor, he having succeeded Mr.
William Pearce, who was appointed March 25th, 1779.&nbsp; Mr.
Samuel Thorncroft, the present Assistant-Overseer, was Mr.
Rice&rsquo;s assistant, and helped Mr. Chassereau, the then
Assistant-Overseer, in preparing the present Workhouse for the
reception of the poor, who were very reluctant to leave the old
house, to be transported out of the world, as they termed the
removal to the new house on Church hill, which certainly then had
as desolate an appearance as the &ldquo;howling
wilderness,&rdquo; the name now given to the Industrial Schools
at the Warren Farm, by the opponents of that juvenile
establishment.&nbsp; The Assistant-Overseer, previous to Mr.
Chassereau, was Mr. White, who succeeded Mr. Jonathan
Grenville.&nbsp; At this period the principal officers in
connexion with the poor of the parish, were an
Assistant-Overseer, at a salary of &pound;200, and a Vestry
Clerk, at a salary of &pound;100 a-year.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Attree,
of the present firm, Messrs. Attree, Clarke, and Howlett, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>solicitors,
Ship street, was the Clerk, and used to make out the poor-rates,
attend&mdash;usually by deputy&mdash;the meetings of the
Directors and Guardians, record the meetings of the Board, and
the Committees, and prepare reports.</p>
<p>The removal from the old to the new house took place on the
12th September, 1822, when 27 persons changed their
residence.&nbsp; On the 20th of the same month, nine others
followed; and on the 24th, sixty-four more were removed, making a
total of ninety-five inmates.&nbsp; Mr. Baldey was the parish
surgeon.&nbsp; The new governor&mdash;Hayward,&mdash;remained
only a few days on the removal to the new house; as, without the
least intimation to any one, he abruptly took himself off.&nbsp;
His successor, Mr. Nuttall, remained only four or five weeks,
when he was summarily dismissed by the Guardians, on the 5th of
November, 1822.&nbsp; Mr. S. Thorncroft was then appointed
Governor, a situation which he continued to fill with great
honour to himself and satisfaction to the town, till April, 1834,
although he did not leave the house till April, 1835.&nbsp; Mr.
John Harper was Mr. Chassereau&rsquo;s successor.&nbsp; Mr.
Thorncroft was appointed Assistant-Overseer&mdash;a position
which he still so ably holds&mdash;in October, 1834.&nbsp; Mr.
Collington, at the close of 1834, succeeded Mr. Thorncroft as
Governor; and he held the office till the middle of the summer of
1836, when Mr. Bartlett entered on the duties of Governor, he
having been previously the superintendent of pauper-labour, at a
salary of &pound;160 a-year.</p>
<p>At the old house Mrs. Idle was a species of matron; but when
the inmates went &ldquo;up the hill,&rdquo; Mrs. Harriet Dennett
held that appointment, and continued it till 1827, when she was
succeeded by Mrs. Alice Pickstock.&nbsp; Mrs.
Pickstock,&mdash;the mother of Mrs. S. Thorncroft,&mdash;died in
1843.&nbsp; As a memento of respect, her tomb, erected by
subscription in the Cemetery Ground of the Old Church, expresses
the appreciation of her valuable services.&nbsp; On her death,
Mrs. Bartlett, the wife of the Governor, was appointed
Matron.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett resigned in June, 1848, and
were succeeded by Mr. and Mrs. Cuzens.&nbsp; About the middle of
the year 1849, Cuzens absented himself from his duties, and they
were in consequence both discharged in September.&nbsp; Mr. and
Mrs. Hodges were appointed to the vacancies, and they held their
respective offices till September <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>of the following year.&nbsp; Mr. and
Mrs. C. J. King succeeded them, and in October, 1854, on their
resignation, Mr. and Mrs. Passmore entered upon their
duties.&nbsp; On the 7th of June, 1859, Mr. Passmore absconded;
the dismissal of himself and wife ensued in consequence, and on
the 15th of July, Mr. and Mrs. Sattin were appointed to fill the
vacancies.</p>
<p>The poor-rate collectors hitherto have been Mr. Edward Butler,
Mr. Harry (Captain) Blaber, Mr. W. H. Smithers, and Mr. Frank
Butler.&nbsp; The parish assessors have been Mr. Saunders, Mr.
Robert Ackerson, Mr. Richard Bodle, Mr. Henry Styles Colbron, Mr.
Richard Edwards, and Mr. George Maynard.</p>
<p>The original cost for building the Brighton Workhouse was
&pound;10,000, and the land was purchased for &pound;1,400, and
paid by a rate expressly raised for that service.&nbsp; In the
year 1853, the then Board of Directors determined upon disposing
of the present Workhouse and grounds, and the erection of a
Workhouse and Industrial Schools, and they purchased ground on
the Race Hill, as the site for the former, and the Warren Farm,
beyond the Race Hill, for the latter.&nbsp; The Schools are
completed, and will be ready for occupation when a sufficient
supply of water is obtained from the notorious Warren Farm
Well.</p>
<p>There have been occasions when the Guardians, in the plenitude
of their duties towards the poor, and also to the ratepayers,
have made their Board meetings the opportunity for feasting and
guzzling.&nbsp; The most memorable time was in the summer of
1837, when they pampered their appetites with john-dorees,
salmon, lobsters, Norfolk squab pie, poultry, and joints in
profusion; red and white wines by the dozen, and spirits by the
gallon; cigars by the box, and snuff by the pound; with a
handsome snuff-box, too; and, the usual services of the House
being too mean for them, sets of dish-covers were ordered, and
dishes, dinner and pie plates, jugs, sauce tureens, cut decanters
and stands, rummers, knives and forks, waiters, and a
teaboard.&nbsp; Blacking too, was ordered, and one Guardian, Mr.
Paul Hewitt, actually sent his boots to the Workhouse to be
cleaned, and when done they were returned to his house
again.&nbsp; Another Guardian, Mr. Storrer, also sent his dog to
the Workhouse to be kept, as it was inconvenient to have it at
home.&nbsp; The Guardians <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>had also a summer house, wherein they
smoked their cigars and quaffed their grog.&nbsp; This was at the
period when out-door paupers had to slave up the Church hill for
relief.&nbsp; The removal of the Board-room to Church street, the
Pavilion property, has been a great convenience to the poor, and
it has been the means of preventing even a hint that the present
Board feast at the parish expense.</p>

extracts from the parish books, will not be found out of
place:&mdash;</p>

<p>But a quarter of a century since it was customary to employ
the out-door paupers in scavenging, cleansing, and watering the
streets, the poor creatures being harnessed, by means of ropes,
to the muck-trucks and barrel-constructed water-carts, after the
manner that convicts are put to labour in the Government penal
establishments and the navy dockyards.&nbsp; The parish officers
eventually got shamed out of the system of thus employing those
whose only crime was poverty; and for awhile they substituted the
health-destroying and heart-breaking plan of wheeling shingle and
sand from the beach to the Workhouse-ground in barrows, till one
unhappy creature sunk beneath his burthen and died of
&ldquo;disease of the heart!&rdquo;&nbsp; The custom then was
abandoned.&nbsp; The course now pursued towards the indigent is
thoroughly to investigate their several cases, and relieve them
according to their necessities and deserts: and where laziness
and not misfortune is the cause of their penury, to give them an
&ldquo;Able Bodied Ward&rdquo; ticket of admission to the
Workhouse, which not one indolent person in fifty avails himself
or herself of, but rather leaves the Board of Guardians,
dissatisfied, and eventually resolves upon an attempt at
industry, which results in a benefit to themselves and the
ratepayers.&nbsp; The system has succeeded beyond all
expectations; and many a man who considered the
&ldquo;house&rdquo; his birthright, because his father and his
grandfather from time immemorial wintered there, has taken to
provident and industrious habits, and learned the sweet uses of
adversity.</p>

THE ATTACK ON BRIGHTHELMSTON BY THE FRENCH, IN 1545.</h2>
<p>Henry the Eighth having ravaged Artois and Picardy, by the
superiority of his forces, and made himself master of Boulogne,
the French king to retaliate the wanton desolations, sent Admiral
D&rsquo;Annehault with a considerable fleet to devastate the
country on the southern coast of the island.&nbsp; The invasion
is thus described by Holinshead:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 37 Hen. 8th, 1545, July the 18th, the
admiral of France, Mons. Donebatte, hoisted up sails, and with
his whole navy (which consisted of 200 ships and 26 gallies,)
came forth into the seas, and arrived on the coast of Sussex,
before Bright Hampstead, and set certain of his soldiers on land
to burn and spoil the country: but the beacons were fired and the
inhabitants thereabouts came down so thick, that the Frenchmen
were driven to their ships with loss of diverse of their numbers,
so that they did little hurt there.&nbsp; Immediately hereupon
they made to the Isle of Wight, when about two thousand of their
men landed, and one of their chief captains, named Chevalier
Daux, a Proven&ccedil;ois, being slain with many others, the
residue, with loss and shame, were driven back again to their
gallies.&nbsp; And having knowledge by certain fishermen whom
they took, that the king was present on the coast, (Portsmouth)
and a huge power ready to resist them, they disanctioned
(disanchored) and drew along the coast of Sussex, of whom few
returned to their ships; for divers gentlemen of the country, as
Sir Nicholas Pelham and others, with such power as was raised
upon the sudden, took them up by the way and quickly distressed
them.&nbsp; When they had searched every where by the coast, and
saw men still ready to receive them with battle, they turned
stern, and so got them home again without any act achieved worthy
to be mentioned.&nbsp; The number of the Frenchmen was great, so
that diverse of them who were taken prisoners in the Isle of
Wight and in Sussex, did report they were three score
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A curious Picture Map of this attack is engraved in the 24th
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>vol. of
the &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia&rdquo; of 1832, from the original in
the Cottonian Library.&nbsp; A copy of this map is in the
possession of the compiler of this history.&nbsp; It bears date,
&ldquo;1545, July, 37 Henry VIII.&rdquo;&nbsp; The number of
ships attacking the town is twenty-two; and the largest, probably
the Admiral&rsquo;s, lying nearest the shore, has four masts;
seven have three masts, three two masts, and eleven are galleys
with one mast and numerous oars.&nbsp; Eight of the latter are on
shore, and the armed men from them have disembarked on the beach,
the place where they landed being inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;here
landed the galleys.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the shore also, high and dry,
are six large boats of the inhabitants, and several smaller
ones.&nbsp; On the beach, likewise, at Hove, are five small
boats.&nbsp; On the sea, towards the west side, is
inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;Shippes may ride all somer tem in a myle
the town in V fathome water;&rdquo; and on the
east,&mdash;&ldquo;Thesse grete shippes rydeng hard abode shore
by shoting into the hille and wallies on the towne, so sore
oppresse the towne that the countrey dare not adventure to rescue
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ships are pierced for guns, and the prows
and sterns are raised three or four stages.&nbsp; Numerous
pennons and streamers adorn each ship, some bearing a
<i>fleur-de-lys</i>, and others a cross.&nbsp; On shore the
houses under the cliffe are on fire; from the upper town also
flames are issuing from almost every house.&nbsp; There are five
rows of houses running from north to south; and at the extreme
north a row of houses runs from east to west.&nbsp; A square
space in the centre is marked,&mdash;&ldquo;A felde in the middle
of the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; A road to the east of the town, about
the spot now occupied by the Old Steine, and going in the
north-east direction is inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;the valey comyng
from Lewes town to Brighthampston.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this road and
on the hill adjacent bodies of armed men are marching towards the
town.&nbsp; On the cliffe, eastward of this road, is an erection
from which is suspended a frame containing some burning
substance, and is inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;the towne fyre
cage.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is at about the spot where the offices
and auction room of Messrs. Parsons and Son now are.&nbsp; From
thence, eastward, is inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;The East pte of
brighthampston riseng onelye on cleves high.&rdquo;&nbsp; North
of the town is the church, about which persons, some armed,
appear in the attitude of prayer.&nbsp; Beyond the church are two
mills, marked,&mdash;the &ldquo;wynde mylles;&rdquo; and still <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>farther a
blazing construction on a pole, marked,&mdash;&ldquo;the bekon of
the towne.&rdquo;&nbsp; A road from this spot is continued to the
sea, about midway between the church and Hove Church,
marked,&mdash;&ldquo;hoove Churche.&rdquo;&nbsp; This road, along
which armed men are coming towards the town, is
inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;the valey comyng from pouynge (Poynings)
betwixt brighthampston and the vilage, hove.&rdquo;&nbsp; As this
road approaches the beach it is inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;Upon this
west pt may lond <span class="GutSmall">CM</span> psones (100,000
persons) unletted by any pvision there.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the back
of the town is inscribed,&mdash;&ldquo;The towne of
brighthampston,&rdquo; and immediately to the east of the town is
a body of armed men.&nbsp; Hove,&mdash;two rows of
houses,&mdash;is marked, &ldquo;hove village,&rdquo; and the road
running westward from thence, &ldquo;the west parte of
brithampston lowe all daungerous and wout cleves (without
cliffs.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next attempt of the French was on Newhaven, where they
landed to a considerable number, and proceeded to pillage the
town and environs; but the gentry and yeomen of the coast having
been collected on the neighbouring hills to oppose the expected
descent, attacked the invaders so vigorously that many were slain
in attempting to recover their galleys.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XI.<br />
FORTIFICATIONS OF THE TOWN.</h2>
<p>In consequence of the frequent incursions of the French, and
the inhabitants being harassed by frequent alarm, the town
resolved, in 1558, to erect fortifications, to afford them some
protection for the future.&nbsp; A Court Baron of the manor of
Brighthelmston-Lewes was therefore held on the 29th of September
in that year, of which the following entry appears in the Court
Rolls:</p>
<blockquote><p>I Eliz.&nbsp; At a Court Baron, holden for this
manor, 27th September, there was granted to the inhabitants of
Brighton town by the lords, one parcel of land, containing in
length 30 feet, in breadth 16 feet, to build thereon a
store-house to keep armes, &amp;c., now called the
Block-house.&nbsp; Also at the Court holden for Atlingworth
manor, 3 Jac (1606) January 9th, the homage presented that the <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>north part of
the Block-house aforesaid is built on part of the demesnes of
that manor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The land granted was on the Cliff between Black-lion street
and Ship street, and about 215 yards westward of East
street.&nbsp; The Block-house was circular, about fifty feet in
diameter, and the walls were about eight feet in thickness, and
eighteen feet in height.&nbsp; Several arched apartments in its
thick walls were depositories for the powder and other ammunition
for the defence of the town.&nbsp; In front of it, towards the
sea, was a little battery called the Gun Garden, on which were
mounted four pieces of large iron ordnance.&nbsp; Adjoining the
Block-house, on the east, stood the Town-house, with a dungeon
under it for malefactors; and on the summit of this building rose
a turret, on which the town clock was fixed.&nbsp; At the same
time with the Block-house, were erected four gates of freestone,
(three of which were arched) leading from the Cliff to that part
of the town which lay under it, namely, the East Gate at the
bottom of East street; the Portal, which was called the
Porter&rsquo;s Gate, and was less than any of the others; it
stood next the East Gate; the Middle Gate, opposite the end of
Middle street, commonly called the Gate of All Nations; and the
West Gate, which stood at the end of West street.&nbsp; From the
East Gate, westward, there was, at the same time, a wall built
about fifteen feet high, and four hundred feet long, where the
Cliff was most easy of ascent: and from the termination of that
wall, a parapet three feet high, was continued on the verge of
the Cliff to the West Gate, with embrasures for cannon.&nbsp; The
Block-house was built at the expense of the mariners of the town;
but the gates and walls were erected partly if not wholly by the
government.</p>
<p>The south of the town was thus effectually secured.&nbsp; For
the security, then, of the other three sides, on any emergency,
trenches might be cut at the end of the streets which led into
the town, or the entrances might be barred to the enemy by lumber
carriages and household furniture, while the inhabitants annoyed
them from every quarter.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Magna Britannia,&rdquo;
in addition, says, &ldquo;The town contains seven streets, and as
many lanes, but the most spacious of them is devoured by the
Ocean,&rdquo; alluding to South street, under the cliff, which it
is supposed formed the sea front of the town.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>The
town book, under the date 1580, has the following inventory of
the &ldquo;great ordnance, and other munition and furniture in
Brighthelmston,&rdquo; viz., four iron pieces delivered out of
the tower, on the bond of John Slutter, together with powder and
shot delivered with the same, two pieces of great ordnance, and
ten &ldquo;qualivers with their flasks and touch boxes,&rdquo;
and a drum belonging to the town.</p>
<p>The town also at that time possessed one windmill, purchased
of Queen Elizabeth, and the site of another mill then in ruins;
&ldquo;the town-house, situate to the east side of the
block-house,&rdquo; granted by a copy of court roll by the lords
of the Manor of Brighthelmston, and the said block-house,
&ldquo;of flint, lime, and sand, of late years erected, and built
in warlike manner, by the fishermen, with the profits of their
quarter share.&rdquo; <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a></p>
<p>There is no record as to the date when the fortifications in
general were destroyed; but it is generally supposed the gradual
inroads of the sea sapped them and caused them to fall.&nbsp;
Certainly they were not demolished by any foreign invader, as
after 1545 the town was never attacked.</p>
<p>In 1586, when the whole kingdom was alarmed with rumours of
the Spanish Armada, a fleet of about fifty sail were discovered
off the town, apparently waiting for a favourable opportunity to
land.&nbsp; The terrified inhabitants, concluding it was the
great Spanish force, fired the beacons and sent off for Lord
Buckhurst, who was lord of one of the manors of the town.&nbsp;
His Lordship attended with as many armed men as he could muster
on so sudden an emergency, and took post on the brow of the cliff
between Brighthelmston and Rottingdean, in order to oppose the
landing of the supposed enemy at their place.&nbsp; In the course
of the ensuing night, his force increased to the number of 1,600
men: and a considerable body of Kentishmen were on their march to
join him.&nbsp; Next morning, the ships appeared in the same
place; but those on board showed no disposition to land.&nbsp; A
few boats, belonging to the town, ventured out at last, a little
way, to reconnoitre the fleet, and soon discovered, to their
great joy, they were only Dutch merchantmen <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>laden with
Spanish wines, and detained by contrary winds in the Channel.</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, 1588, the town was more justly
alarmed at the Spanish Armada; and the inhabitants neglected no
means in their power to defend themselves and their country from
the threatened desolation by a powerful and inveterate
enemy.&nbsp; They had then in the town, belonging to Government,
six pieces of great iron ordnance, and ten qualivers, a species
of small cannon.&nbsp; With a determination of the most obstinate
resistance, the shores of Sussex in general were lined with the
people, when this tremendous armament passed in their view,
pursued by the light and expert navy of England.</p>
<p>In 1597, in consequence of the continued war with Spain, and
Brighton being exposed, by an order of Sessions, dated July 13th,
and signed Robert Sackville, Thomas Pelham, Nicholas Parker,
Antho. Sherley, and Ran. Nevill, by command of Lord Buckhurst,
Lord Lieutenant of the County, there were sent from Lewes to
Brighthelmston, one saker and one minion, with their carriages,
shot, horse-harness, budges, barrels, ladles, sponges, and all
other necessary implements belonging to the same, with six
barrels of gunpowder; and such was the educational condition of
the people at that period, that Thomas Jeffery, the Constable of
Brighthelmston, to whom the artillery and stores were delivered,
could not write his name.&nbsp; In 1642, the four pieces of iron
ordnance, sent to Brighthelmston in 1597, were returned to
Lewes.&nbsp; In the same year, also a barrel of gunpowder was
sent from the town house, Lewes, (where was the powder store,) to
Brighthelmston.</p>
<p>In the Court Rolls, according to the Burrell MSS., 1st April,
1645, there are the following records:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Homage present Willm. Gallan, jun., for not paying
to Rd. Cook, lord&rsquo;s reeve, for his lady nets fishing,
according to ye ancient custom, 4d, give him time to pay it to
the said R.C., at or before St. Jn. Baptist next, on payn of
5s.</p>
<p>25 Aug., 1648.&nbsp; We present Nichs. Payne for building his
new house and shop under the cliffs, upon the bank of the cliff,
to the hurt and annoyance of the whole towne, if we shd have any
occasion to use the ordnance, or that there shd be any invasion
by a foreign enemy.</p>
<p>25 Aug., 1654.&nbsp; We present Nics. Payne for encroaching on
the lord&rsquo;s waste, and building of his walls 14 feet, or
thereabout, more than he is admitted to, to ye cliffe side,
before ye place where ye great guns path doth stand, to the <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>great
annoyance and hindrance of ye whole towne and country, and we
fine him for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1658, John Pullat, a Quaker, for speaking to the
priest and people in the Steeple-house (the church), was put
prisoner into the Block-house, which, at that time, was the place
of confinement for malefactors.</p>
<p>In the course of the encroachments of the sea during severe
storms in 1703 and 1705, the Blockhouse and Gun-garden, wall and
gates, were gradually sapped, and at last so completely
destroyed, that in the course of thirty years afterwards,
scarcely any of their ruins were perceptible.&nbsp; The following
is the record of these storms in the Brighton
town-book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Memorand.&mdash;November 27th, 1703, there was a
very great and remarkable tempest, <a name="citation67"></a><a
href="#footnote67" class="citation">[67]</a> which begun after
midnight, and continued in its violence till about 8 in the
morning, being Saturday.&nbsp; Many houses in town were
damnified, two wind-mills in the east blown over, several of the
church leads turned up, and several vessells belonging to the
town were Shipwracked, to the great impoverishment of the
place.</p>
<p>Another storm, 11th of August, 1705, did equal damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Burrell MSS. record, Jan., 1748&ndash;9, that by reason of
extraordinary high tides the sea broke in at Brighthelmston,
washed away part of the Block-house, and the farm lands called
Salts, and did considerable damage to the lands adjacent.</p>
<p>On digging out the shingle for the purpose of laying in the
foundation of the wall which forms the south boundary of the
King&rsquo;s Road, the ruins of the Block-house were discovered
in so compact and firm a state that much difficulty was
experienced in excavating them and breaking them up.&nbsp; Less
than ninety years since at low water, the well of the old town
was visible off the Old Ship Tavern, its steined form standing
somewhat high above the sand and shingle.</p>
<p>Lord Macaulay, in his history of England, speaking of the time
of Charles II., says:&mdash;&ldquo;Brighton was then described as
a place which had once been thriving, which had possessed many
small fishing barks, and which had, when at the height of
prosperity, contained about two thousand inhabitants; but which
was sinking fast into decay.&nbsp; The sea was gradually gaining
on the buildings, <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>which at length almost entirely disappeared.&nbsp;
Ninety years ago the ruins of an old fort were to be seen lying
among the pebbles and sea-weed on the beach, and ancient men
could still point out the traces of foundations on a spot where a
street of more than a hundred huts had been swallowed up by the
waves.&nbsp; So desolate was the place after this calamity that
the vicarage was thought scarcely worth having.&nbsp; A few poor
fishermen, however, still continued to dry their nets on those
cliffs, on which now a town, twice as large and populous as the
Bristol of the Stuarts, presents, mile after mile, its gay and
fantastic front to the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. William Gilpin,
prebendary of Salisbury, and vicar of Boldre, near Lymington, in
&ldquo;Observations on the Coasts of Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent,
made in the Summer of 1774,&rdquo; states:&mdash;&ldquo;The cliff
on which Brighthelmston stands, is composed of a mouldering clay;
and the sea has gained upon it, at least fifty yards in the
memory of man.&nbsp; A fort which stood on the edge of the cliff,
gave way in the year 1761, and was shattered into a ruin; but it
is now taken entirely down.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, probably, refers
to some portion of the old fortifications of the town, which
stood to the east of the Block-house.</p>
<p>About the year 1761, a battery, with an arched room under it
for ammunition, was erected at the bottom of East (great) Street,
not far from the site of the ancient East Gate.&nbsp; A letter
dated Brighthelmston, August 12th, 1782,
states:&mdash;&ldquo;About seven o&rsquo;clock yesterday morning,
I was awaked by the firing of guns, which made me rise sooner
than I should otherwise have done, and upon going to the beach,
was informed that a French privateer, of 16 or 18 guns, and about
130 men, had just taken a collier close to the shore.&nbsp; After
having turned the collier&rsquo;s men in their own boat on
shore,&mdash;they only wanting the vessel,&mdash;the Frenchmen
put on board the collier from the privateer, ten stout fellows,
and then sailed away with their prize.&nbsp; This being observed
from the ramparts, signal was given to a cutter, which happened
luckily to be near, and it directly made sail after the collier,
and in about an hour and a half retook her, and sent the
Frenchmen on shore.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ramparts alluded to were
those of the East Street battery, which was wholly unprotected by
any groyne, and was completely undermined <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>by the sea on
the 17th of November, 1786, and fell to the ground.&nbsp; There
were at the time seventeen barrels of gunpowder in the magazine
below; but fortunately none of them took fire amidst the crash of
the ruins.&nbsp; Dunvan <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a> states that this
battery mounted 12 twenty-four pounders; but on the platform as
represented in a map of Brighton, 1779, eight guns only are
placed.&nbsp; The eight guns were deposited on the Steine, and
remained there for several weeks.</p>
<p>The condition of these guns and the value of the battery will
be better gleaned from the following memorandum, made Thursday,
September 23rd, 1779:&mdash;&ldquo;Some French privateers are
said to be hovering about the offing, and we hear now and then a
report of firing.&nbsp; Provoking!&mdash;They will not come
within reach of the only four guns that may be fired with
safety&mdash;I mean, when properly loaded with powder and
ball&mdash;a salute is nothing.&nbsp; The rest are all well known
to be honey-combed.&nbsp; The small craft, then, may be cut off
with impunity.&nbsp; What a pity that a couple of light
six-pounders cannot be spared by the Board of Ordnance, to
protect the coast!&nbsp; Those with men or horses, might be
dragged along the Clift, and prevent every sort of mischief to be
dreaded from such despicable picaroons;&mdash;instead whereof,
two horse soldiers, in long scarlet cloaks, ride along the coast,
making their utility to be understood by no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The site of this battery is marked by the Old Battery House,
opposite the Rising Sun, to which is attached the following
legend of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">OLD
STRIKE-A-LIGHT:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tremendous gale had ceased, but still the mountainous
swellings of the sea burst violently on the shore, when the boat
of Swan Jervoise came into the Brighton roadstead, having
weathered the storm.&nbsp; The night was pitchy dark; scarcely
could the outline of the horizon be perceived, and not a light
illumed the blank.&nbsp; The surprise of Jervoise and his crew
was therefore great when they beheld a stream of meteor-like
splendour burst from every window of the &lsquo;Rising Sun&rsquo;
Inn, and as suddenly all was <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>again involved in utter
darkness.&nbsp; This terrific appearance was repeated many
times.&nbsp; Swan Jervoise was one of those men who never
conjecture, but proceeded at once to ascertain a cause.&nbsp; He
therefore, with two of his men, went ashore; but proceeded alone
to the &lsquo;Rising Sun,&rsquo; expecting to find the people
up.&nbsp; After knocking and bawling loud enough to rouse all the
dead in the Bartholomew&rsquo;s Chapel, without wakening the
landlord, he was about to force the door, when the light again
burst from the windows, and he distinctly heard a ticking as of a
person striking a light with a flint and steel, each stroke
producing this supernatural blaze of light.&nbsp; In a moment
afterwards the door was opened, and a being seven feet high,
wrapped in a large black cloak, with a high conical white hat,
issued forth.&nbsp; He noticed not the poor drenched fisherman,
but he strode on until he disappeared in the darkness.&nbsp;
Jervois&rsquo;s hair stood, stiff on his head; his limbs trembled
with fear; and he shrieked aloud with terror.&nbsp; The landlord
heard his cry, and came down with his torch.&nbsp; Seeing his
neighbour in such a plight, he bade him come in, roused up a
fire, made him take a seat in the capacious chimney,
and&mdash;having comforted him with good words&mdash;placed a
rushlight on the table, and then retired to procure a jug of
ale.&nbsp; Jervoise, scarcely recovered from his fright, was thus
again left alone.&nbsp; As he sat musing by the crackling fire,
the dim rush throwing a fitful light around the room, he chanced
to turn his head; when, from over the back of the settle, he
beheld the deathlike features&mdash;pallid as a sear
cloth&mdash;of the tall man in the conical hat.&nbsp; His
countenance was most ghastly, and he fixed his grey-glazed eyes
full on Jervoise, and pointed to the hearth.&nbsp; This was more
than he could bear,&mdash;he uttered one loud scream, and fell
senseless to the ground.&nbsp; He was thus found by the landlord,
who conveyed him to bed; and the next day Jervoise related the
particulars to Father Anselm, of St. Bartholomew, and then
expired.&nbsp; But the blessed Virgin and Saint Nicholas
oft-times bring good out of evil; for on examining the hearth to
which &lsquo;Old Strike-a-Light&rsquo; (as the apparition has
since been called) pointed, a vast treasure was found, which is
still safely deposited with the principal of this order in
Normandy; nor has the &lsquo;Rising Sun&rsquo; since been haunted
by the unholy spirit of &lsquo;Old Strike-a-Light.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>The
faithful may therefore know there is no truth in the story that
&lsquo;Old Strike-a-Light&rsquo; has lately been seen seated
astride a barrel of beer in the cellar chinking a piece of money
on a pewter dish.&nbsp; The family vault of Jervoise, the oldest
in the churchyard of Brighthelmston, Anno Domini <span
class="GutSmall">MCXVII</span>, may still be seen on the south
side of the church&mdash;near Tattersall&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the latter end of the year 1793, two new batteries
were commenced for the defence of the town; one on the West
Cliff, which mounted eight 36-pounders, and the other on the East
Cliff, which mounted four of the same weight.&nbsp; The guns of
these batteries were of French casting, ship guns, taken from the
French fleet captured by Lord Howe, in his memorable victory of
the 1st of June, 1794.&nbsp; The latter of these batteries was at
the bottom of the Marine Parade, opposite the south-end of German
Place; but after being in position about ten years,&mdash;as the
explosions of the guns and the encroachments of the sea had made
the walls dangerous,&mdash;it was removed.&nbsp; The west battery
was opposite Artillery Place.&nbsp; The Sea Fencibles,
volunteers, during the war with France used to practice at this
battery.&nbsp; They were accustomed, also, to exercise with
boarding-pikes, in Belle-vue field, now Regency Square.&nbsp;
Colonel Moore&rsquo;s volunteers went through their initiation
drill, with faggot-sticks, on the ground behind the battery
house, Artillery Place.&nbsp; Colonel Moore resided on the Old
Steine, in the mansion which was afterwards occupied by Lady Ann
Murray, and then by Mr Harrington, (Squire Harrington, as he was
usually spoken of,) now the residence of Captain
Thellusson.&nbsp; This noble structure was erected by the Right
Honourable W. G. Hamilton, Esq., formerly M.P. for
Haslemere.&nbsp; According to a manuscript diary in possession of
the compiler of this history: &ldquo;On the 17th of August, 1805,
soon after 12 o&rsquo;clock, a shot was discharged from this
battery by the Sea Fencibles, at a cask moored purposely in the
offing, and it fell very close to the object: a second shot was
also fired, of 42 pounds weight, merely to ascertain to what a
distance the gun would throw it.&nbsp; From the time of the
explosion until it struck the water, there was a lapse of 27
seconds; the ball consequently, ere it was received by the liquid
clement, must have traversed to a distance of three miles.&nbsp;
The <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>weight
of the cartridge used was 14 pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also, June
13th, 1807: &ldquo;The Volunteers this morning, for the first
time this year, were practised at the Fort, in discharging the
forty-two-pounders at a cask, moored, and floating on the water,
at about three quarters of a league distant from the shore.&nbsp;
Twelve rounds were fired; and though some of the balls
immediately struck the object, they generally dropped so close to
it, that a moderate sized fishing-boat would scarcely have
escaped being injured by either of them.&nbsp; Many elegant
spectators were on the Cliff during the exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The west battery was removed in 1859.&nbsp; A flagstaff within a
railed space, marks its last site; as, twice after its original
construction, it was removed with the sanction of Government, to
admit of widening the King&rsquo;s Road at that spot, to
accommodate the increased traffic.&nbsp; The battery house and
the other buildings in connexion with the Battery, were disposed
of by auction by Mr. P. R. Wilkinson, on Monday, September 9th,
1861, and by the 28th of that month the space was entirely
cleared for the erection of an hotel, Government having disposed
of the ground to the Brighton Hotel Company.&nbsp; The remnant of
the battery platform, marked by the flagstaff, belongs to the
town, the Corporation having purchased it of Government to
prevent any other purchaser placing buildings upon it.&nbsp;
Brighton thus, wholly depends upon such means of defence as the
emergency of the occasion may require to be brought into
operation, by means of the railway, the facility of transit
offering the full assurance that every <i>materiel</i> would be
at hand for the ready service of our Volunteers, should an enemy
have the temerity to invade our shores and put to the proof every
Englishman&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;<i>Pro aris et
focis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

THE INCURSIONS OF THE SEA UPON THE TOWN.</h2>
<p>Brighton has not had merely to defend itself against the
aggressions of foreign invaders, but the encroachment of the sea
at various times has checked its prosperity.&nbsp; Between 1260
and 1340, upwards of 40 acres of land had become submerged, <a
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> and the sea made continual inroads
upon the lower town.&nbsp; Previous to 1665 twenty-two copyhold
tenements under the Cliff, belonging to the manor of
Brighthelmston-Lewes, alone were swept away.&nbsp; Amongst them
were twelve shops, with four stake places and four capstan-places
attached to them, and three cottages and three parcels of land
adjoining them. <a name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b"
class="citation">[73b]</a>&nbsp; There still remained under the
Cliff, 113 tenements (shops, capstan and stake places, and
cottages) which were destroyed by the memorable storms of 1703
and 1705.</p>
<p>The storm of 1703 commenced about midnight on the 27th of
November, and continued for eight hours with unabated fury.&nbsp;
Many houses were demolished; and others were unroofed: the church
leads were torn off; and the two mills belonging to the town,
were prostrated by the storm.&nbsp; The town presented the
ruinous appearance of a place severely bombarded.&nbsp; Nor was
that the only disaster looked for by the dismayed inhabitants,
from so dreadful a conflict of the elements.&nbsp; The bulk of
their property, and their dearest relatives, were at the same
time exposed to its utmost fury on the ocean, and the most dismal
apprehensions for their fate were in many of them but too fully
realised.&nbsp; Deryck Paine, master of the ketch,
&ldquo;Elizabeth,&rdquo; was lost with all his crew.&nbsp; George
Taylor, master of the ketch, &ldquo;Happy Entrance,&rdquo; was
lost with all his crew, except Walter Street, who supported
himself on a mast for three days, between the Downs and North
Yarmouth, and was taken up at last.&nbsp; Richard Webb, master of
the ketch, &ldquo;Richard and Rose,&rdquo; was lost with all his
crew, near St. Helen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Edward Freind, master of the
ketch, &ldquo;Thomas and <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Frances,&rdquo; was stranded near
Portsmouth.&nbsp; Edward Glover, master of the pink,
&ldquo;Richard and Benjamin,&rdquo; was stranded near
Chichester.&nbsp; One man was lost; the master and the rest of
the crew saved themselves in the shrouds.&nbsp; George Beach,
master of the pink, &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; was driven from the Downs
to Hamburgh, with the loss of anchors, cables, and sails.&nbsp;
Richard Kitchener, master of the &ldquo;Chomley&rdquo; pink, was
lost, with nine of her crew; five men and a boy were saved by
another vessel.&nbsp; Many able seamen, belonging to the town,
were also lost in the Queen&rsquo;s (Anne&rsquo;s) ships of war,
transports and tenders.</p>
<p>The 11th of August, 1705, was marked by another dreadful
storm, which began at one in the morning, attained its greatest
fury at three, and raged until eight.&nbsp; It completed the
destruction of all the lower buildings which had escaped the fury
of all former inundations.&nbsp; Every habitation under the Cliff
was utterly demolished, and its very site concealed from the
owner&rsquo;s knowledge beneath a mound of beach.&nbsp; The roof
of the parish church again also suffered much, the lead being
completely stripped away.&nbsp; A record of this event is
preserved in the tower of the church, beneath the bell storey; on
the wall of which is nailed a tablet of sheet-lead, measuring
4ft. 6in. by 2ft. 6in., that was taken from the roof of the
sacred edifice on the restoration of the church in 1853.&nbsp; It
is inscribed in raised east characters, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">RICHARD MASTERS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">RICHARD TVPPEN.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">JOHN MASTERS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">CHVRCHWARDENS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1 7&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above the names is a cherub at each corner of the tablet; and
between the 7 and 0 are represented two nude children amidst <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>scroll-work,
which is surmounted with an angel in the act of sounding a
trumpet.</p>
<p>Dr. Mantell remarks that at Brighton the inroads of the sea
have been very extensive.&nbsp; The whole of the ancient town was
situated on the spot which is now covered by the sands, and the
present cliffs were then behind the town, like those of Dover;
and Mr. Lyell, in his &ldquo;Principles of Geology,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The sea has merely resumed its position at the
base of the cliffs, the site of the old town having been a beach
which had for ages been abandoned by the ocean.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the <i>Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angli&aelig; et Walli&aelig;</i>,
<i>auctoritate P. Nicholas</i> (A.D. 1292), and <i>Nonarum
inquisitiones in coria scaccarii</i> (A.D. 1340), mention is made
that the losses of land sustained by the action of the sea,
between the years 1260 and 1340, a period of only eighty years,
were in Brighthelmston, 40 acres; in Houve, 150 acres;
Aldrington, 40 acres; and in Portslade, 60 acres.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Magna Britannia,&rdquo; of 1737,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;About 90 years ago, this Town was a very
considerable Place for Fishing, and in a flourishing Condition,
being then one of the principal Towns of the County, containing
near five hundred Families; but since the beginning of the Civil
Wars it hath decayed much for want of a Free Fishery, and by very
great Losses by Sea, their shipping being often taken from them
by the Enemy: Nay, it is the Opinion of the most judicious
Inhabitants, that had not Divine Providence in a great Measure
protected them by their Town being built low, and standing on a
flat ground, the <i>French</i> would several times have quite
demolished it, as they had attempted to do, but the low Situation
of it prevented their doing it any considerable Damage, the
Cannon Balls usually flying over the Town; But the greatest
Damage to the Buildings has been done by the breaking in of the
Sea, which within these forty years hath laid Waste about 130
Tenements; which Loss, by a modest Computation, amounts to near
40,000<i>l.</i> and if some speedy Care be not taken to stop the
Encroachments of the Ocean, it is probable the Town will in a few
years be utterly depopulated; the Inhabitants being already
diminished one-third less than they were, and those that remain
are many of them Widows, Orphans, decrepid Persons, and all very
poor; insomuch that the Rates for their Relief are at the
Rack-Rent of <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>8d. in the Pound, for there are but few Charities given
for their Support, <i>viz.</i> one by Mr. Barnard Hilton <a
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a> of 16<i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>, with
some other small Benefactions, which make it about 20<i>l.</i> a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1706 there had been considerable wrecks of wines on the
Manor of Brighthelmston-Lewes; and the then Lord High Admiral
claimed them as his right.&nbsp; But Richard Onslow, Esq., and
Colonel Tufton, as proprietors of the manor, kept the wines; and
on a full investigation of the business at the assizes for the
county, in 1708, their conduct, in that particular, was
justified, and their manorial right fully established.</p>
<p>On the 4th of March, 1818, as Mr. Izard was having excavations
made for the foundations of two houses on the West
Cliff&mdash;now the King&rsquo;s Road,&mdash;between Ship Street
and Middle Street, the workmen discovered the walls of one of the
streets under the Cliff, which had been overwhelmed by one of the
terrible inundations of the sea.&nbsp; They appeared buried more
than fifteen feet with beach.</p>
<p>In 1713, the sea having destroyed everything below the Cliff,
encroached with alarming rapidity on the Cliff itself, fragments
of which daily crumbled into the sapping tide.&nbsp; It was
therefore found absolutely necessary, for the preservation of the
rest of the town, to erect groynes before it.&nbsp; These groynes
are contrived by means of strong wooden barriers projecting from
the Cliff towards the sea, as far as low-water mark, which
intercept and confine the beach or sea shingle, that chiefly
rolls from west to east in this part of the English
Channel.&nbsp; By these contrivances, a large body of beach,
rising gradually towards the Cliff, is accumulated on the western
side of every barrier, which resists and breaks the impetuosity
of the roughest sea.&nbsp; But the reduced state into which a
coincidence of unfavourable circumstances had sunk
Brighthelmston, about the beginning of the last century, it was
impossible for the inhabitants to raise amongst themselves a sum
nearly adequate to so expensive an undertaking.&nbsp; A brief was
therefore granted them, under which <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>they collected about
&pound;1,700.&nbsp; By means of this public aid, and the internal
contributions of the town itself, the Cliff was pretty well
secured from the west part, as far as the Old Steine.&nbsp; The
groynes eastward of the Steine are comparatively of modern
construction, the most important of them being,&mdash;in its
original state,&mdash;that constructed on the suggestion and plan
of Mr. Edward Thunder, at Black Rock, about the year 1819, when
the sea was rapidly encroaching at that spot and threatening to
make inroads upon the whole of the Marine Parade.&nbsp; The
barrier was effectual, although on its projection and erection it
was called by the shortsighted of the time, &ldquo;Teddy
Thunder&rsquo;s Folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thunder, who was one of the
Town Commissioners at the time, was an eccentric but shrewd
man.&nbsp; He was the inventor of the pedal for shifting the keys
of the piano-forte.</p>
<p>Groyne is quite a provincial term of very doubtful
origin.&nbsp; It is generally supposed to be a corruption from
<i>royne</i>.&nbsp; An Act of Parliament was passed in the House
of Commons, in 1698, for opening of the ancient <i>roynes</i> and
water courses in Sedgmore.&nbsp; And it is probable that these
<i>roynes</i> are the same as <i>groynes</i> at Brighton, with
this difference, that the latter are artificially constructed for
a certain purpose, and the former might have been only a slow
acervation of time and nature.&nbsp; The following is an extract
from a letter, dated Lewes, September 12th,
1785:&mdash;&ldquo;The violence of the wind on Tuesday last,
occasioned the highest tide that has been known on this coast for
a great number of years.&nbsp; At Brighthelmston, the fishermen
were put to the greatest difficulty in saving their boats; to
effect which, many were under the necessity of hauling them up
into the town, and others of lashing them to the railing on the
bank.&nbsp; Some few, however, that could not be secured, were
dashed to pieces; had the storm happened in the night-time, the
whole must have shared the same fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the Town Act of Brighton, 1772, a duty of 6d a chaldron was
levied on all coal landed on the beach; and by the Act of 1810, a
duty of 2s 6d a chaldron&mdash;now a ton,&mdash;was levied on all
coals brought into the town, for the purpose of constructing and
supporting the sea-defences of the town.&nbsp; By the
construction of these groynes, the sea from time to time was
driven back to allow of the <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>building of the sea-wall that
protects the whole of the southern road in front of the town,
from the bottom of Cannon Place to the extreme east of the
parish.&nbsp; The first portion formed was that between West
Street and Middle Street, and was opened by George IV. in the
year 1821; prior to which time the houses there were only
approached at their south front by a temporary wooden platform on
poles, for foot-passengers only; and then only during fair
weather; as so close to the houses were the rage and flow of the
sea during a storm, that the planks which formed the pathway, had
to be removed to prevent their being either washed or blown
away.&nbsp; At such times a barrier was erected at each end, at
Bradley&rsquo;s Library, now Booty&rsquo;s, and the
Ship-in-Distress Inn, <a name="citation78a"></a><a
href="#footnote78a" class="citation">[78a]</a> now Child&rsquo;s
Fancy Repository, bearing the notice, &ldquo;No
thoroughfare.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only way for equestrians and
vehicles was the present South Street, where was the following
quaint sign over the shop of an eccentric shoemaker:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lives a man that don&rsquo;t refuse<br />
To make and mend your boots and shoes.<br />
His leather&rsquo;s good, his work is just,<br />
His profits small, and cannot trust:<br />
And when grim death doth him call,<br />
Farewell to his old cobbler&rsquo;s stall.</p>
<p>To his blood royal highness P.G.,<br />
And new laid eggs every <i>day</i>. <a name="citation78b"></a><a
href="#footnote78b" class="citation">[78b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last two lines were in red letters, and the initials P.G.,
were intended for Prince George.</p>
<p>The encroachments of the sea, till the complete groyne system
was carried out and the sea-wall completed, extended from Russell
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Street to
the extreme east end of the parish; and after every storm of any
magnitude, the road to the east of the Old Sterne,&mdash;now
known as the Marine Parade,&mdash;presented a different aspect,
as the inroads of the sea frequently carried away some hundreds
of tons of the Cliff; and it was no uncommon thing after a
tempest, to find that so much of the roadway had been carried
off, from the Cliff becoming undermined by the wash of the waves,
as to leave only sufficient space for a single vehicle to
pass.&nbsp; On the 15th of December, 1806, during a terrific
storm, the roadway between the Royal Crescent and Rock Buildings
was completely cut asunder, making the owners of property there
uneasy for the safety of their premises.&nbsp; This storm gave
occasion to the following trial at the Sussex Assizes, held at
Lewes, August 4th, 1807:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE KING <i>v.</i>
GREGORY, PHILCOX, THUNDER, AND THREE OTHERS.<br />
RIOT AT BRIGHTON.</p>
<p>This was an indictment against the defendants, for riotously
assembling and pulling down the railing on the road east of
Brighton, leading from thence to Rottingdean, and obstructing the
Surveyors of the road in the execution of their duty.&nbsp; This
case arose out of the falling of the cliff last autumn.&nbsp; The
Surveyor of the Road thought it necessary to carry in the
railing, and trenched upon the ground of the three first named
defendants: they considered he had done more than necessary, and
resisted his altering the railing.&nbsp; In consequence of this,
on the 11th of February last, they employed men to cut down the
polls and rails, which had been erected by the Surveyor of the
Road.&nbsp; The next day the Surveyor employed men to re-erect
them, and the defendants another party to pull them down.&nbsp; A
riot ensued, the one set pulling down as fast as the other
erected, until at last the Surveyor&rsquo;s party were the
victors.</p>
<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>, for the defendants,
rested his defence on the ground that the Surveyor was not under
the necessity of coming upon their freehold, but that he had
acted wantonly and with a view to harass the defendants.&nbsp; He
proposed calling evidence to shew that the road at that part of
it was perfectly safe.</p>
<p>The Learned Judge held that the Surveyor of the road was
clearly right.&nbsp; He was to judge of the necessity if he acted
wrong.&nbsp; They ought to have brought an action of trespass,
and not to have the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>The jury found them all guilty.&nbsp; The three principals
were fined &pound;20 each, and the three workmen &pound;5
each.&nbsp; In the Civil Court an action was tried, arising out
of the same transaction, in which the plaintiff had a verdict
against the Surveyor.&nbsp; Damages, seven guineas.</p>

THE DOWER OF ANN OF CLEVES.</h2>
<p>At the Reformation, when the monastery of St. Pancras, at
Southover, was destroyed, by order of Henry VIII., on its being
surrendered to that monarch, by Prior Robert Crowham, November
16th, 1537, the manor of Southover, Lewes, which included the
priory, was granted to Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, who also
held one moiety of the manor of Brighthelmston-Lewes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>4.&nbsp; Hen. VIII.&nbsp; One moiety of this
manor, with several other possessions in Sussex, was recovered by
petition, by Thomas, Earl of Surrey, they having been devised by
the Marquis of Berkeley, to Henry VII., and an act passed in the
7th of that king, whilst the petitioner was absent on the
king&rsquo;s business in the north, and ignorant of it till the
said parliament was ended.&nbsp; The answer is &ldquo;<i>Soit
fait come il est desiree</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petition is contained in the Burrell MSS. 5637.&nbsp;
Folios 36 and 37.</p>
<p>On the attainder and execution of the Earl of Essex, Sir John
Gage, of Firle, was appointed chief steward of Southover and
other manors forfeited by that nobleman within the county of
Sussex.&nbsp; But on the 20th of January, 1541, they were granted
to Ann of Cleves, one of the injured queens of Henry VIII.&nbsp;
The Burrell MSS. record:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>32.&nbsp; Hen. VIII.&nbsp; The King granted this
manor (Brighthelmston-Lewes) and advowson to Ann of Cleves; with
a great many others in Sussex, including the manor of Falmer
(originally Fald-mer), which, on her death, again reverted to the
crown, and after various successions and alienations, was
purchased of Sir John Shelley, of Michelgrove, by Thomas, Lord
Pelham, on the 2nd day of May, in the year 1770.&nbsp; It still
continues in the possession of the Pelham family, being held by
the Earl of Chichester, of Stanmer, the manor adjoining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Strickland, in her &ldquo;Lives of the Queens of
England,&rdquo; says:&mdash;&ldquo;The marriage was dissolved by
mutual consent; and she being content to abide in this realm, and
to yield to its laws, and to discharge her conscience of that
pretended marriage, the king, of his especial favour, granted to
her certain manors and estates in divers counties, lately
forfeited by the attainder of the Earl of Essex,&mdash;Cromwell,
whose spoils formed the principal fund for the maintenance of
this princess,&mdash;and Sir Nicholas Carew, to be held <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>without
rendering an account from the Lady-day foregoing the same grant,
which was dated on the 20th of January, 1541.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These grants were made to Ann by Henry VIII., on her assent to
the invalidity of her marriage with that monarch, who refused to
consort with her.&nbsp; On the 8th of August, 1540, Henry married
Catherine Howard.&nbsp; The manor of Falmer was also part of
Ann&rsquo;s dower, and in seclusion there she resided some time;
though on her divorce she took up her abode at Preston House, in
the village of Preston, where still, in one of the rooms, is a
large and well executed portrait of her, by some considered the
work of Holbein.&nbsp; It was seeing this portrait which induced
the king to desire an union with hor.&nbsp; She landed at Dover,
December, 1538.&nbsp; Henry met her there, and such was his
dislike to her, from her beauty not being equal to
Holbein&rsquo;s portrait, that he spoke of her as a
&ldquo;Flander&rsquo;s Mare,&rdquo; and used other expressions
respecting her of an equally contemptuous character.</p>
<p>Ann died on the 17th of July, 1557, at the Palace of Chelsea,
and was buried on the 3rd of August, near the high altar, in
Westminster Abbey, near the old portraits of Henry III. and King
Sebert.</p>
<p>The manor formerly belonged to the Shirley family, several
monumental tablets to the members of which remain within Preston
church.&nbsp; Mary, the second sister of Sir Richard Shirley,
Bart., was married to Thomas Western, Esq., of Ravenhall, in
Essex, who died April 1st, 1733, leaving an only child, Thomas
Western, who married Ann, the daughter of Robert Callis, Esq.,
and died in May, 1766, leaving Charles Western as his heir.&nbsp;
Charles Western, Esq., married Frances Shirley, only daughter and
heiress of William Bolland, Esq.&nbsp; His end was of the most
melancholy character.&nbsp; Whilst riding with his eldest son,
Charles Callis, a child then about four years of age, along the
road by Goldstone Bottom, the horse stumbled, and they were
precipitated from their carriage, the father being killed on the
spot.&nbsp; The life of the child was preserved by his being
thrown into a furze bush, by the roadside.&nbsp; This occurrence
took place on the 24th July, 1771.&nbsp; The widow, with her two
children, Charles and a younger brother, Shirley, about three
years old, shortly after left Preston, where <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>none of the
family ever after returned, and the estate eventually was
purchased by William Stanford, Esq., for &pound;20,000.&nbsp; His
grand-daughter, a minor, is his heiress; and so improved is the
estate, through the favourable circumstance of the railroad from
Brighton to London passing through it, that the portion alone
used for the formation of the line realized &pound;30,000.</p>
<p>Charles Callis Western, who was born on the 9th of August, was
created Baron Western, on the 28th of January, 1833.&nbsp; He
died, unmarried, in 1841, when, his brother being dead, the title
became extinct.</p>

THE PARISH CHURCH, ST. NICHOLAS.</h2>
<p>This sacred edifice is situated upon a hill north west of the
town, about 160 feet above low-water mark.&nbsp; It is a
structure of great antiquity, and was originally dedicated to St.
Nicholas, Bishop of Mira, in Lycia, who lived about the
commencement of the fourth century, and was the reputed patron of
fishermen, on account of the following naval miracle recorded of
him in the legends of that country: A certain Lycian vessel being
in great danger during a storm at sea, the affrighted crew
invoked the aid of this pious prelate, and lo! to their amazement
and comfort, a venerable personage appeared amongst them, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;Here I am, for ye called me.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
his help, the ship was successfully managed until the storm
subsided; and then their miraculous assistant vanished.&nbsp; The
mariners had no sooner reached the port, than they enquired for
Bishop Nicholas, and were directed to the cathedral, where they
beheld in him the identical person to whom they owed their
safety.&nbsp; His feast is held on the 6th day of December, and
used to be celebrated with devout dependence by the mariners of
Brighthelmston, before the Reformation.&nbsp; But in the spirit
of pious avarice or cunning, the Virgin Mary was, in process of
time, made joint tenant with St. Nicholas, in the patronage of <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>this
church.&nbsp; &ldquo;The second dedicator,&rdquo; says Dunvan,
&ldquo;seems to have shrewdly considered that Nicholas could not,
either as a saint or a gentleman, object to so fair and exalted a
partner; and that in case any of the seafaring inhabitants of the
parish were at any time in danger, either their Holy Patron, or
more Holy Patroness, would most probably be at leisure to step to
their succour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This church was given by Ralph de Cheney to the Priory of
Lewes, in the reign of Stephen.&nbsp; But it appears from the
terms of an award or arbitration between Richard de Wich, Bishop
of Chichester, and William de Ruslous, Prior of St. Pancras, near
Lewes, made in 1252, still extant in the episcopal archives at
Chichester, that the priory obtained no full possession of this
church before that period.&nbsp; By this award, as soon as the
then Rector of Brighthelmston should die, or resign the living,
the Prior of St. Pancras was to appoint a Vicar there, who was to
have all the offerings of the altar, as far as they belonged to
altarage, and the small tithes, viz., those of mills,
sea-fisheries, mortuaries, wool, lambs, cheese, cows, calves,
hogs, colts, geese, hens, eggs, flax, hemp, and of every thing
that grows in gardens, except wheat and barley.&nbsp; He was also
to have the third of the tithe of hay, and a convenient mansion
assigned him.&nbsp; To encourage a crusade, in consequence of the
capture of Acre by the Soldan of Babylon, Edward I. granted to
Pope Nicholas IV. the tenths of all the monasteries and churches
in England, and in the <i>Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angl&aelig; et
Walli&aelig; auctoritate P. Nicholas</i>, 1291, occur these

<p>The Vicar of Brighton was at one period saddled with a yearly
pension of seven shillings and sixpence to the Vicar of Hove; and
in this state the Vicarage continued, the impropriation of the
great tithes vesting in the Priory of Lewes, till the suppression
of that monastery, in 1538.&nbsp; The impropriation and patronage
of this parish were granted by Henry VIII. to Lord Cromwell, his
Vicar-General, who in that year, 1538, ordered a public register
of baptisms and burials to be kept at Brighthelmston, and in
every other parish of the kingdom.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>On the
death and attainder of Cromwell, the church was conferred by
Henry to his repudiated queen, Anne of Cleves, and on the death
of that princess, in 1557, it again reverted to the crown.&nbsp;
In the reign of Elizabeth, the patronage and impropriation were
severed, the former being attached to the see of Chichester; and
so it continues to the present day.&nbsp; There is a great tithe
on Brighton, of small extent, now belonging to Thomas Attree,
Esq., Queen&rsquo;s Park, Brighton, as Lay-Rector, and it
formerly belonged to Thomas Read Kemp, Esq., as Lay-Rector.</p>
<p>The church is built of cut flints and grouting of lime and
coarse sea-sand, with stone coignes.&nbsp; The old map picture of
1545, represents the church as cruciform, and the tower circular:
probably errors of the artist, whose design was doubtless more to
illustrate the prominent features of the scene,&mdash;the attack
upon and burning of the town,&mdash;than the architectural
details of the buildings.&nbsp; The sacred edifice consists of a
body, chancel, and a somewhat low embattled tower, surmounted by
a sloping roof, in the centre of which is a cast-iron standard,
in which is a flagstaff that may be raised or lowered at
pleasure.&nbsp; An arrow vane is on its top.&nbsp; Formerly,
within the last half-century, the vane was represented by a gilt
fish, doubtless intended as the representation of a dolphin; but
in 1796 a visitor, considering that the figure bore more
resemblance to a shark than any other fish, penned the following
verses upon it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Say, why on Brighton&rsquo;s church we see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden shark display&rsquo;d,<br />
But that &rsquo;twas aptly meant to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An emblem of its trade?</p>
<p>Nor could the thing so well be told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In any other way:<br />
The town&rsquo;s a Shark that lives on gold,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company its prey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A musical peal of eight bells was cast in 1777, by Mr.
Rudhall, ironmonger, of the firm Rudhall and Dudlow, North
street, Brighton, now Langworthy and Reed, at his foundry, at
Bristol.&nbsp; The tenor bell, which is pitched in the key F,
weighs 1,500 pounds.&nbsp; The belfry had a peal previous to that
date, as in the vestry minutes of October 25th, 1736, is the
order:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To new cast the great bell belonging to the parish
church of Brighthelmston, to agree with Joshua Kipling,
bellfounder, to charge on the parish taxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>In
March, 1790, another order was made:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That the treble bell be repaired by Mr.
Palmer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two additional bells were hung in 1818, making a peal of ten
bells; but when the clock, at St. Peter&rsquo;s church, was put
up, the two new bells, which did not accord with the original
eight, were removed to the tower of that church, for chiming the
quarters.</p>
<p>Doomsday Book, 1086, mentions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ibide&rsquo; ten&rsquo; Wills. de Watevile
Bristelmestune de Willo.&nbsp; Uluuard tenuit de Rege E.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>The manor was that of Atlingworth, <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a> and there is no
doubt the church referred to was the present parish-church of St.
Nicholas, which, in its original state, was of Norman
construction.&nbsp; It consists of a nave, with side aisles, and
a chancel, which is separated from the main body by a richly
painted and gilded Tudor screen, over which, at no remote period,
was a rood-loft.&nbsp; To the south, also, of the chancel is a
small chantry.&nbsp; The five arches which separate on each side
the nave from the aisles, and are supported on diagonal pillars,
are of the fifteenth century.&nbsp; To accommodate the great
increase in the population of the town, from time to time,
galleries were constructed wherever it was possible to place
them.&nbsp; In 1852, however, in consequence of the dilapidated
state of the sacred edifice, the restoration of the church was
determined upon.&nbsp; The leader in the desirable movement was
the Rev. H. M. Wagner, Vicar, who having invited some of the
residents and townspeople to meet at the Town Hall, on the 20th
of September, in that year, and having taken the chair, stated
the fact,&mdash;that many years ago, his Grace the late Duke of
Wellington was a pupil of his (the Vicar&rsquo;s) grandfather,
the then Vicar of the parish; and that the Duke was wont to
worship in the Vicarage pew of their <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>parish church.&nbsp; He proposed to
them the restoration of the church as an appropriate and enduring
monument of their gratitude and veneration for his memory.&nbsp;
The proposition was unanimously adopted, and a committee was
appointed to collect subscriptions, which in less than a month
amounted to &pound;5,000, a sum nearly equal to the outlay.</p>
<p>In the chantry, also, a much admired monument or cenotaph was
erected to the memory of the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; This
beautiful work of art, sculptured in stone, by Mr. Philip, of
Vauxhall, after the design of the late Mr. Carpenter, will
henceforth constitute one of the most striking features of the
restored church.&nbsp; It is in the decorated period of Edward
II. and Edward III., commonly known as the Eleanor Cross.&nbsp;
The shape is hexagonal; the height, from the base to summit,
18-ft. 6-in.; the circumference, between 15 and 16 feet.&nbsp;
The pedestal commences with a richly moulded base, rising from a
tesselated pavement.&nbsp; On the base of the pedestal rests a
plinth, covered with diaper-work, surmounted by another moulding,
on the broad chamfer of which is an inscription, in old English
characters, in brass, each line being presented by an angle of
the monument:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">In Memoriam<br />
Maximi Ducis Wellington,<br />
H&aelig;c domus sacrosancta,<br />
Qua ipse adolescens Deum colebat<br />
Re&aelig;difcatur.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Translation</i>.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">In Memory
of</span><br />
<span class="smcap">The Great Duke of Wellington</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">This sacred building</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">In which in his youth he worshipped
God</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Is restored</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the pedestal, and above the moulding with this
inscription, rise two stories, richly and elaborately decorated,
with open tracery-work, and crocketed pinnacles.&nbsp; These are
separated by a pierced parapet of chaste design: and a similar
one is on the third or upper, story, which is a solid stone
drum.&nbsp; Each parapet is also ornamented by sunk and carved
panels.&nbsp; The crowning ornament consists of a <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>canopied
niche, with a pierced spire surmounted by a finial.&nbsp;
Enclosed within this niche, is an alabaster figure of St. George,
sheathing his sword over the dragon, which lies slain at his
feet, symbolical of the career of the great chieftain to whose
memory the work is raised.&nbsp; The drum, with all above it,
rests on a shaft of dark marble, polished, which springs from the
pedestal, and around which winds a scroll bearing the names of
four of those achievements which mark different eras in the
military career of Wellington, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Assaye</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Torres Vedras</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These &ldquo;crowning deeds&rdquo; have been well
selected.&nbsp; Assaye represents the Duke&rsquo;s Indian
campaign; Torres Vedras, his successful defence of Portugal;
Vittoria, the victory which delivered Spain; and Waterloo, the
battle which saved Europe.&nbsp; It is impossible to convey in
words an idea of this beautiful monument, which reflects the
highest credit on its designer.</p>
<p>Immediately in front of this memorial, is a monumental brass
in the pavement, thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In Memory of R. C. Carpenter, who but a short time
survived the completion of his design, the restoration of this
Church, <span class="GutSmall">MDCCCLV</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The font of the church was much admired for the sculpture
which adorned it; but in 1743 its beauty was nearly effaced by
the churchwardens, Thomas Stranbido, William Buckell, and G.
Warden, who had it cleaned, partially re-cut, and their names
carved in the base, a monument of their vitiated taste, confirmed
vanity, and profound ignorance.&nbsp; It is of a circular form,
and is raised from the floor by one step.&nbsp; It has excited
much observation amongst antiquaries, some of whom contend for
its early date, whilst others consider it only a copy; but where
the original is they are at a loss to say.&nbsp; The sculpture
upon it is in four sections.&nbsp; The first represents the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and consists of seven figures; Our Saviour,
crowned with glory, in the centre, is in the act of giving the
blessing, and on the table are distributed various drinking
vessels, with the bread.&nbsp; The next compartment contains a
kneeling figure; the third, which is larger, has a boat on the
sea, with the sail unfurled, and two figures, one presenting a
small barrel or <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>vessel to a bishop, who has his mitre and crozier, and
the other giving bread to a female; both figures in the
water.&nbsp; The fourth division consists of three arches, in
each of which is a figure, the centre appearing to be the
principal.&nbsp; The whole is sculptured in <i>basso
relievo</i>.&nbsp; Over these compartments is a line of zig-zag
and lozenge work, curiously chamfered, and beneath them is a row
of exceedingly handsome ornamental work of leaves and
flowers.</p>
<p>The following are extracts from a diary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sunday, August 29th, 1778.&nbsp; Have been this
morning to the sailor&rsquo;s land mark&mdash;to the only church
in the town&mdash;and collected a number of
<i>novelties</i>.&nbsp; The Doctor was pleased to inform us, in a
religiously political, or politically religious discourse, that
when men <i>tremble</i> they are generally <i>afraid</i>; when
they are in danger they should strive to <i>extricate</i>
themselves; and that <i>hope</i> is the expectant of many great
and singular <i>good events</i>.</p>
<p>Monday, September, 13th.&mdash;A new man and wife have just
passed me.&mdash;The town&rsquo;s-people preserve some customs
here that smack of great antiquity, and seem peculiar to the
county of Sussex.&nbsp; At a marriage there are strewers, who
strew the way from church, not only with flowers, but with
sugar-plums and wheat.&nbsp; Why sugar-plums and wheat, I
wonder?&nbsp; Many ceremonies have been retained longer than the
history of their origin or foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This system of strewing the bride and bridegroom is still
pursued, not merely by the friends of the happy pair,&mdash;all
couples just married are pronounced to be happy,&mdash;but by a
constant group of women with children in their arms, who scatter
their corn, &amp;c., with blessings, in proportion to the harvest
of <i>coin</i> they reap.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 16th century, the Rev. Edward Lowe was
vicar of the parish.&nbsp; His successor was the Rev. John Bolt,
who died on the 2nd of November, 1660.&nbsp; He was succeeded by
the Rev. &mdash; Falkner, who was incumbent till 1705.&nbsp; The
vestry book of the date, &ldquo;November the 2nd, Anno Domini,
1703,&rdquo; records that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That day the Reverend Mr Joseph Grave, Rector off
St. Anne&rsquo;s, Lewes, Sent the works off Mr. Charnock, in two
Volumes of his for the use off the Vicar of Brighthelmstone and
his surveyvors.&nbsp; Each Volume having in gold letters
(Brighthelmston) upon both sides off the cover.&nbsp; The
benefactor at London would no(t) otherwise be known than by the
two letters off his name, H: Y:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same book has also the following entries:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>March 11th, 1707.&nbsp; John Mockford appointed
Clerk at Church; part of his duty is to wash the church linen,
and scour the church plate.</p>
<p>July 8th, 1713.&nbsp; William Cousins appointed Sexton; Mary
Bridger to be equal partner.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>March
31st, 1800.&nbsp; That Thomas Waring be appointed beadle and
cryer at a salary of Twenty pounds and Cloathes.&nbsp; It is
understood that his duty is to make the poor books, the Church
Book, the surveyor&rsquo;s book, and the Town book.&nbsp; He is
also to attend the North and west galleries of the Church on
Sundays.&nbsp; He is to go round the town with the Officers to
make the Militia list, and is likewise to officiate as
Headborough in the Town; but not elsewhere, and to be sworn for
that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rev. William Colbron succeeded to the vicarage in 1705,
and held it till his death, on the 20th of July, 1750.&nbsp; The
next vicar of Brighthelmston, was the Rev. Henry Michell, who was
born at Lewes, in 1714.&nbsp; He finished his studies at the
University of Cambridge, and having obtained a fellowship in
Clare-Hall college, he, at the age of 25 years, was made rector
of Maresfield; and, five years afterwards, the Bishop of
Chichester collated him to the Rectory of West Blatchington, and
the Vicarage of Brighton.&nbsp; In 1747, he married the only
daughter of the Rev. Francis Reade, of Bedford, by whom he had
sixteen children.&nbsp; A marble tablet in the church fully
delineates his estimable character and profound learning.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Magna Britannia&rdquo; says:&mdash;&ldquo;The
church is a vicarage, but meanly endowed.&nbsp; The vicar claims
the old episcopal custom of a penny per head, (commonly called
smoak money, or a garden penny) as also he requires, as his due,
a quarter of a share of all fishing vessels. <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; The parsonage tythes are about
&pound;100 per annum, but are in the hands of an improprietor,
who allows the Vicar no benefit from them, by which means his
maintenance is very small: and therefore the neighbouring
gentlemen have augmented it by a subscription of &pound;50 per
annum, on condition he shall instruct fifty poor boys of the town
in reading and writing.&nbsp; The church stands about forty rods
from the town, at a little distance from the sea.&nbsp; There was
formerly another church, near the middle of the town, which is
said to have been burnt by the French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Michell, died on the 31st of October, 1789, and
was succeeded by the Rev. Thomas Hudson, who commenced the chapel
of ease, in Prince&rsquo;s place, known as the Chapel Royal.</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson died in 1804, and was succeeded by the Rev. Robert
James Carr, afterwards Dr. Carr, of Chichester, and then Bishop
of <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Worcester.&nbsp; The present Vicar, the Rev. Henry
Michell Wagner, grandson of the Rev. Henry Michell, <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> was his successor, August 1st, 1824;
and during the time he has held the appointment, the number of
places of worship attached to the Established Church, which have
been erected, will testify his zeal in the support of our Holy
Religion.</p>
<p>In 1824, Nathaniel Kemp, Esq., presented the church with a
beautiful Communion Service of silver, consisting of a flagon,
two cups, and two plates, thus inscribed: &ldquo;Given by Nath.
Kemp, Esq., and Augusta Caroline, his wife, to the Church of St.
Nicholas, Brighthelmston.&nbsp; Anno Domini, 1824.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon stripping the roof on the restoration of the church, in
1852, three several pieces of inscribed cast lead were preserved,
and they are now fixed to the walls of the tower in the chamber
below the bell story.&nbsp; One piece has been already described
in page 74, the others are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Previous to the restoration of the building, the Church, both
inside and out, had undergone many changes, to afford space; low,
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>gloomy
galleries, scarcely permitting headway for the congregation when
standing, whilst the common house-shaped and dormant windows
disfigured it in all directions.&nbsp; In a dark gallery at the
west, in 1813, was placed an organ, <a name="citation91a"></a><a
href="#footnote91a" class="citation">[91a]</a> built by
Lincoln.&nbsp; It was opened on the 7th of March, that year, by
Mr. Nathaniel Cook.&nbsp; A small organ loft occupies the space
over the vestry room, but it does not at present boast of an
organ.&nbsp; Formerly there were several tablets on the belfry
walls, recording peals which had been rung in the tower.&nbsp;
Their places are now occupied by sundry monuments that were
formerly fixed in other parts of the edifice; and some few of the
ringing records have been removed to the club-room of the
Brighton Society of Change Ringers, at the Running Horse Inn,
King street, <a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a> while the remainder fell into the
hands of a marine-store dealer.&nbsp; The Running Horse Inn was
formerly known as the Hen and Chicken; and in 1792, and for
several years afterwards, was kept by Mr. John Pocock, who at
that time was a sawyer by occupation.&nbsp; In 1795, he received
the appointment of Clerk at the Chapel Royal, when that place of
public worship was first opened; and after retaining the
situation for thirteen years, he <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>was appointed Clerk of the Parish, in
which office he continued for thirty-eight years, dying on the

DR. VICESIMUS KNOX AND THE SURREY MILITIA.</h2>
<p>During the time of the Brighton Camp, in the autumn of 1793,
the Surrey Militia were quartered in the town; and the Parish
Church being then the only place of worship in Brighton, in
connexion with the Established form of Religion, it was not an <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>uncommon
occurrence for some of the officers and men of that regiment, to
attend at the morning service on the Sunday.</p>
<p>In the beginning of August, Dr. Vicesimus Knox, Master of
Tunbridge School, and late Fellow of St. John&rsquo;s College,
Oxford, having come to Brighton with his family, in pursuit of
health, by sea-bathing, and a salutary change of air and scene,
during the anniversary school vacation, hired a house in North
Street, at the corner of Bond Street, now the property of
Alderman Martin, where on Saturday the 10th, he received, quite
unexpectedly, a note from the Vicar, the Rev. Thomas Hudson, to
whom he was a perfect stranger, expressing his desire that the
Doctor would gratify his congregation, as he politely expressed
himself, with a sermon on the morrow.&nbsp; The Doctor shewed
some reluctance to assent to the request, but some friends who
were present, importuned him, and he wrote a reply expressing a
compliance, and on the following morning he ascended to the
pulpit, and took his text:&mdash;Philippians iv.
7.&mdash;&ldquo;The peace of God, which passeth all
understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The sermon,&rdquo; says the Doctor, <a
name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a> &ldquo;was heard by a very large and
very respectable congregation, in which were many of the military
belonging to the Surrey regiment, quartered in Brighton.&nbsp;
The utmost attention was paid to it.&nbsp; The military appeared
to be particularly impressed, and highly satisfied.&nbsp;
Expressions of approbation were heard, too emphatic for me to
repeat.&nbsp; Mr. Hudson, the Vicar, who read prayers, came to my
house, on purpose to thank me, in his own name, and that of his
congregation.&nbsp; He mentioned the general satisfaction I had
given; the many inquiries that had been made after my name by
strangers; and expressed a hope, that I would preach once more,
as he knew it was the wish of his parishioners.&nbsp; This,
however, I declined at that time, and certainly had no intention
to preach again at Brighton, though I had every reason to be
pleased with my reception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following evening, Monday, August 12th, the birthday of
the Prince of Wales, the Doctor was present at the Ball at <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the Castle
Tavern, and partook of the supper which was given in honour of
the occasion.&nbsp; Marked civility was shewn him from persons
who knew him only from the sermon which had been so favourably
received on the Sunday.&nbsp; The Vicar especially, paid him the
greatest attention, and continued in his company nearly the whole
of the evening, and in the course of it, renewed his request,
that as his parishioners very much wished it, he would give him
another sermon on the following Sunday.&nbsp; The Doctor&rsquo;s
reply was:&mdash;&ldquo;I come here for recreation, after the
fatigues of my daily avocations and my own parish church, and I
do not wish to be interrupted by exertions of this kind,
especially as I find my last sermon has excited so general an
attention, and probably raised expectation too high.&nbsp; You
mention the praises I have received; but I will not preach for
the sake of praise.&nbsp; If you say it will serve you, if you
wish to be absent, or if it is any relief to you, I will
endeavour to prepare a sermon in the midst of the interruptions
of this place, and will preach next Sunday, though I sincerely
wish to decline it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The request was continued, and obtained a compliance.</p>
<p>The subject chosen was, &ldquo;The prospect of perpetual and
universal peace to be established on the principles of Christian
philanthropy,&rdquo; his text being, &ldquo;Glory to God in the
highest, on earth peace, good-will towards men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was led to the choice of this subject,&rdquo; writes the
Doctor, &ldquo;from observing the extreme bitterness expressed,
even in gay and good-humoured companies, against a great part of
our fellow creatures; from the almost daily accounts in the
newspapers of slaughtered thousands, and the eagerness with which
war had been adopted by all the nations concerned, when
negociation might have effected every desirable purpose, without
expense, and without carnage. * * * * Had I even gone to the camp
and discoursed, as a chaplain, on the same topic, it could not
have been out of place.&nbsp; But every one who came to the
church knew that he must hear peace, charity, good-will,
forgiveness of enemies recommended, in hearing the lessons from
the gospel.&nbsp; If my sermon was deemed ill-placed in
recommending universal peace and universal good will in Brighton
Church, what will men, who judge so, say of the gospel read
there? <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>what of the national liturgy, established by law as
firmly as the national militia? * * * * I was heard in silence,
and, if I can judge, <a name="citation95"></a><a
href="#footnote95" class="citation">[95]</a> with great
attention.&nbsp; I was not conscious that any part of the
congregation was offended, nor did I surmise it till after the
following incident.&nbsp; On going out of the church, a lady, a
perfect stranger, accosted me and said, &lsquo;I thank you for
your sermon.&nbsp; I could have sat hours to have heard such with
pleasure.&nbsp; But excuse me&mdash;I must tell you, that from
what I have observed in the pews, among a certain description of
persons, you have offended those, who, I fear, have as little
relish for the doctrine of forgiveness as they seem to have of
peace.&nbsp; Many, like myself, are highly pleased with every
part of your discourse; but there are those who are angry
indeed!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the termination of the service, the Doctor and his family
unmolested, returned to their residence, where they had a few
friends to dine with them; and after dinner he attended the
afternoon service, as, understanding that some of the officers
were offended at his discourse, he was desirous of meeting them,
to learn what had given them offence, that, before
misrepresentation could take place, a full and amicable
explanation might be given.&nbsp; He did not, however, meet with
a single officer; and having heard the Curate, the Rev. J.
Mossop, preach, he returned home to tea with his family, and
afterwards took a walk on the Steine, still hoping to meet his
offended hearers, that he might acknowledge his fault, if he had
been in the wrong, and remove their mistake if they thought him
so undeservedly; being desirous of a reconciliation.&nbsp; Many
officers were there, but he did not recognise any of those who
were at the church.&nbsp; From the inhabitants who observed him
he received the utmost civility.</p>
<p>On his return home he received a letter from a stranger, who
expressed a wish to distribute a number of copies of the sermon
in a distant county, concluding his epistle: &ldquo;A
dissemination of such <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>enlightening and convincing knowledge
is only wanting to stop the effusion of human blood; for when
mankind are well awakened, they will not permit the dignified
human butchers, the insolent, unfeeling traffickers in blood, to
lead them to destruction.&mdash;Sunday, Aug. 18.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor, in his &ldquo;Narrative,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;&ldquo;I beg leave to mention as I proceed, that from
the pulpit, where I must have had a pretty good view of the whole
church, I saw very few officers; and of those few I knew not one
even by name: I thought there were not twelve.&nbsp; Of common
soldiers the number was also inconsiderable; I thought there were
scarcely twenty, and these were not of the camp, but of the
Surrey militia quartered in the town.&nbsp; There were, indeed,
more of the same regiment in the porch or in the church-yard; but
too remote from the pulpit to hear a syllable of sedition, if
there had been any to hear.&nbsp; I mention the paucity of
officers and privates for the following reason; the public has
been taught by mistaken prints to believe that I was guilty of
preaching peace and good-will before the whole camp, that the
aisle was crowded with soldiers, and that all the officers of the
camp attended.&nbsp; I appeal to the parishioners present,
whether the number of military men, privates and officers
included, was greater than I have conjectured.&nbsp; My sermon
was not exclusively calculated for a congregation of persons in
any particular profession.&nbsp; There was not a word addressed
by an apostrophe, as I have heard it asserted, to the
officers.&nbsp; I had no reason to suppose that any military men,
but those of the Surrey militia quartered at Brighton, would be
at the church.&nbsp; I thought, and I believe it was so, that
divine service was performed by the chaplains in the camp, and
that the soldiers of the camp would not be permitted to straggle
to the town or the church, on a Sunday, during divine
service.&nbsp; The public has been much deceived in the
exaggerated accounts of my preaching to the whole army; but had
the whole army been at the church, had it been allowed or been
possible, I am certain they would have heard nothing from me, but
what was authorized by the gospel, enforced by the law of man as
well as of God, tending to promote their happiness in all events,
and animating them to the discharge of every duty, on principles
of humanity and Christianity.&nbsp; I <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>expressly asserted, while I was
deploring the calamities of war, that the conductors of war were
often men of singular humanity and honour.&nbsp; I expressly
commended the beautiful gradation of ranks in society.&nbsp; I
enforced good order; I deprecated anarchy as much as
despotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Monday, Dr. Knox visited the Downs, where the army was
assembled in review, and in the evening, as usual, he went on the
Steine; but though, at both places, as he was afterwards
informed, the sermon was a topic of conversation, no insult was
offered, nor was any personal application made to him.&nbsp;
Tuesday evening was the time when the offence of Sunday was to be
avenged.&nbsp; A friend of the Doctor, having to return to London
the next day, proposed that they and some of the Doctor&rsquo;s
family should go to the Theatre.&nbsp; The Doctor assented; and
accordingly Mrs. Knox, Master Knox (aged about 14), and Miss Knox
(12), accompanied them, the piece to be represented being the
<i>Agreeable Surprise</i>.&nbsp; They occupied the right-hand
side box, next to the stage box, where the Prince of Wales
usually sat: but he was not there that evening.&nbsp; Soon after
the curtain drew up, a few officers entered the opposite
stage-box.&nbsp; But they had not been there five minutes, before
their whole attention seemed fixed on the box where the Doctor
and his party were seated.&nbsp; Other officers and several
elderly ladies soon appeared in the same box; and they looked at
the Doctor in a pointed manner, and then seemed to
deliberate.&nbsp; Their attention appeared to be engrossed by the
consultation, and they seldom turned to the players on the
stage.&nbsp; There were several other officers interspersed in
other boxes.&nbsp; Messages were sent to some of them, and they
removed into the stage box.&nbsp; A man, whose looks were
choleric, and who sat in the same box and on the same seat with
Doctor Knox, was sent for, and he left his hat behind him,
probably intending to return when he should be excluded.&nbsp;
They frequently went in and out, and appeared extremely busy and
anxious in concerting the plan of operations.&nbsp; This
continued during the whole of the play.&nbsp; The children
observed it, and told their father that they suspected some
insult.&nbsp; Between the play and the entertainment, the
following note, directed to the Doctor, was handed from behind
them, to Mrs. <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Knox, who gave it to her husband.&nbsp; The son had seen
one of the officers writing; and there is no doubt but he was
composing this note, which was sent without a name, and couched
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your Discourse last Sunday was so
offensive, that the gentlemen of this Theatre desire you will
quit it immediately.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He read the order, and, giving it to Mrs. Knox, rose, and
addressing himself to the opposite boxes, which, however, were
now nearly-empty, <i>the military having accompanied their
despatch</i>, requested to know who had sent the impertinent
paper without a name.&nbsp; He turned back to a phalanx of
military men, who had now come round, and were drawn up behind
the Doctor at the door of his box, and in the Lobby.&nbsp; The
Doctor stept a little forward, and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Ladies and
gentlemen, I have this moment received an extraordinary paper,
neither signed nor dated, containing a requisition that I should
quit the Theatre immediately, on account of the sermon which I
preached last Sunday morning in your parish church.&nbsp; I beg
pardon for interrupting you; but under these circumstances, and
surrounded, as you see I am, I humbly entreat the permission of
the house, to ask aloud who sent me this note, and by what
authority I am bound to obey it, in this place of public
entertainment, where my family and myself have entitled ourselves
to unmolested seats, by paying the price demanded at the
door.&nbsp; We have interrupted nobody.&nbsp; Will you authorize
the arbitrary expulsion of us all? for my family and friend will
certainly follow me.&nbsp; I beg leave, besieged as you see me by
a considerable number of men behind me, who are at this moment
expressing their anger by opprobrious names, to enter into a
short explanation with them, to ask the particulars of my offence
in <i>your presence</i>, and to declare, that if anything
advanced in my sermon gave personal offence, it was
unintentional, and that I am concerned at it.&nbsp; If any one of
these gentlemen will prove to your satisfaction that he is justly
offended, I will immediately beg his pardon.&nbsp; I beg
<i>your</i> pardon, who are totally unconcerned in this attack,
for this singular interruption, which I trust I shall obtain from
you, as men and Englishmen; when you have before your eyes a
defenceless individual, in a situation so singular, as will, I
hope, justify my present address to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>During
the Doctor&rsquo;s address the persons in uniform kept up an
incessant clamour, the most outrageous expressions being used,
such as:&mdash;&ldquo;A democratical scoundrel that deserves to
be hanged,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A democrat, a democrat, a
d&mdash;d democrat,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Out with the
democrat,&mdash;no democrats,&rdquo; the expressions being
lavishly interlarded with scoundrel and rascal, and the
interjections Bah! Boo! Boh!&nbsp; One of the party exclaimed,
&ldquo;No speech,&mdash;that won&rsquo;t do,&mdash;he ought to be
hanged,&mdash;out with him;&rdquo; while another suggested
personal violence before the offender should be allowed to
depart.&nbsp; A grim, gaunt figure vociferated,
&ldquo;Irons,&mdash;irons, here: he ought to be put in irons
directly.&rdquo;&nbsp; All, however, was <i>vox et preterea
nil</i>, notwithstanding one, very much out of breath with
hooting and yelling, crying out &ldquo;Go directly,&mdash;you
must go;&rdquo; whilst from behind resounded the cry &ldquo;Out
with him,&mdash;a democrat, a democrat, a democrat,&mdash;no
democrat, a d&mdash;d democrat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eventually the
Doctor and his party were allowed to depart unmolested, though
during the time he was separated from his family in the lobby, a
tall officer, when Mrs. Knox was turning back to look for her
daughter, violently pushed her by the shoulder, and bade her
&ldquo;go along after her husband, and be d&mdash;d.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One, somewhat ashamed of his companions&rsquo; behaviour,
however, assured her that no violence should be used, and
added,&mdash;&ldquo;He should not have come amongst us.&nbsp; Had
he stuck to peace we should all have admired him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another, nodding his terrific plumes, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is
well his wife and children are with him, or else, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; The son happening to cry &ldquo;Shame upon
you!&mdash;near twenty to one,&rdquo; one of the valiant party
shook him violently, saying at the same time, &ldquo;Who are you,
you dog?&nbsp; You ought to be hanged as well as your
father,&mdash;if it is your father: and all such as hold his
democratical principles, you dog, you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor avers that though the world had been told that they
were a parcel of drunken boys who committed the outrage, the
ringleaders were veterans in age, if not in service; and he
adds:&mdash;&ldquo;Very few were my hearers in the church, the
major part being wholly influenced by the false representations
of gossips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 21st of August, Dr. Knox and his family
having occupied Mr. Grantham&rsquo;s house, in North Street, a
month, <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>the period for which it was engaged, left Brighton; and
soon some of the newspapers teemed with magnified accounts of a
mutiny having broken out in the Brighton Camp through the
Doctor&rsquo;s democratical sermon.&nbsp; The most virulent was
the <i>True Briton</i>.&nbsp; He also received numerous insulting
and threatening letters; and one silly epistle, dated Wick Camp,
near Brighton, enclosed a painted bloody hand.&nbsp; The
<i>World</i>, of August 27th, 1793, declares the treatment which
the Doctor and his family received to be most unjustifiable.</p>
<p>The following letters of the Rev. Mr. Mossop, Curate of
Brighton, who officiated in the Desk on the 18th of August, and
was present during the delivery of the whole of the alleged
obnoxious sermon, completely exonerates Dr. Knox from all blame
in the transaction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;From my
situation in the church at Brighthelmston the day you favoured us
with a sermon, which gave such high offence to a certain
description of gentlemen, I have, as may naturally be supposed,
had my ears sufficiently stunned with enquiries relative to this
sermon, both by many that were present, as well as the
absent.&nbsp; From some of the former, I have experienced no
small portion of ill-nature, because I could not conscientiously
join in the cry with those who can judge the motives of their
neighbour better than he can himself, and pronounce it at once
seditions, libellous, traitorous, democratic.</p>
<p>The answer I have given to the latter description of
inquirers, was in substance, &ldquo;That I doubted not but that
Dr. Knox would submit his sermon, in proper time, to that public
at large, which is better able to judge, and generally more
candid, than interested individuals, who often misapprehend, but
more frequently misrepresent, a subject, to apologise for
illiberality and malevolence;&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;That that
christian charity, which men of our order ought to entertain one
towards another, would not allow me to suppose, that Dr.
Knox&rsquo;s motive was to hint, in the most distant manner, at
the subvertion of our present happy constitution and government,
but merely to expatiate on the advantages of universal peace and
good-will among mankind, and to reprobate the decision of
disputes by the umpirage of the sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May I, therefore, take the liberty to ask, whether you have it
in intention to publish the sermon, or not? that I may have an
opportunity of gratifying my inquirers with a more satisfactory
answer.&nbsp; As I am partly a stranger to you, I beg you will
excuse this liberty; and remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Rev. Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient humble servant,<br />
J. <span class="smcap">Mossop</span>.</p>
<p>Brighthelmston, 12th Sept., 1793.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Rev. Dr.
Knox.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I duly
received yours of the 17th inst.; and as I look upon you to be
misrepresented to the public, relative to the sermon you preached
at <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>Brighton, and consequently loaded with no small degree
of unmerited opprobrium, I shall willingly contribute my mite to
exonerate you.&nbsp; You have, therefore, my permission to
publish my letter to you of the 12th of September last, in your
intended vindication; provided your publication contain no
invectives against the present existing government, nor any
sentiments which might be improper for one zealously attached to
our most excellent constitution to countenance.</p>
<p>I must conclude, by saying, that if every clergyman is to be
exposed to insult, for doing what he conceives to be his duty, in
exposing the reigning vices of the age, we shall soon find that
the feeble rays of religion, which yet remain, to enlighten the
christian world, will soon become totally eclipsed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, Rev. Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient humble servant,<br />
J. <span class="smcap">Mossop</span>.</p>
<p>Brighthelmston, 19th Nov. 1793.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Rev. Dr.
Knox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a refutation that the appellation
&ldquo;&lsquo;Democrat,&rdquo; could with any degree of truth be
attached to Dr. Knox, the following extract from his published
remarks cannot fail to suffice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I honour the King and the Prince; and I firmly
believe that they would scorn to persecute or to oppress, at the
instigation of the most opulent peer in the realm, the most
defenceless individual, the most abject outcast, the most forlorn
beggar in the British empire.&nbsp; I may be abused, reviled,
forced out of theatres, but no man shall rob me of my
loyalty.&nbsp; The father of his people shall ever find me a
dutiful son; and the Prince himself shall not excel me as a
peaceable subject, and a friend to law and order.&nbsp; Though he
is certainly in all other qualities as much above me, as he is in
birth, rank, and the glorious prospect of one day ruling over a
great, enlightened, and a free people, he shall not excel me in a
zeal for the interests of my country and of the human race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many persons endeavoured to induce Dr. Knox to take legal
proceedings against his cowardly assailants; but he contented
himself by sparing his pocket, publishing a narrative of the
transaction,&mdash;now a rare work, although it went through
three editions,&mdash;and lampooning, in a pamphlet called
Prolegomena, those &ldquo;Gentlemen of the Brighton
Theatre,&rdquo; who, to be revenged on him, magnanimously
insulted and assaulted his wife and his children.</p>

THE OLD CHURCHYARDS.</h2>
<p>Many persons have a natural predilection for wandering amongst
the tombs.&nbsp; Whether in a town or village, their first
impulse on arriving at a strange place, is to visit its common
burial place, to ruminate amongst the tombs.&nbsp; A vastness, a
solemnity, and a hallowedness seem to prevade the spot; and the
mind in quietude has an indulgence there, a moralizing never
exceeded even within the precincts of a sacred edifice.</p>
<p>The Poet has said,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
grave can teach<br />
In silence, louder than divines can preach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A celebrated moralist thus expresses himself on
Epitaphs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When I look upon the tombs of the great, every
emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the
beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with the
grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with
compassion; when I see the tombs of parents themselves, I see the
vanity of grieving for those whom they must quickly follow; when
I see kings lying by those that deposed them&mdash;when I see
rival wits placed side by side, or the holy men that divided the
world with their contests and disputes, I reflect with sorrow and
astonishment on the little competitions, factions, and debates of
mankind; when I read the several dates of the tombs of some that
died yesterday, and some six hundred years ago, I consider that
Great Day, when we shall all of us be contemporaries, and make
our appearance together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Brighton old churchyard there is vast material for thought,
as great a diversity &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo; existing as in any
burial place in the kingdom; the space being extensive and the
monumental inscriptions numerous.&nbsp; Time has obliterated many
epitaphs, and destroyed numerous tombstones, few records of the
departed being discernible of dates previous to the 18th
century.&nbsp; Thirty years since there were several wooden
erections to record the memory of the dead; the memorial example
of a catachresis, which</p>
<blockquote><p>Words abused implies;<br />
As, over his head a wooden tombstone lies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the minutes of a Vestry Meeting held March 16th,
1791, it was: &ldquo;Ordered that the Clerk of the Vestry do make
enquiry whether the minister of the parish has a right to demand
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>a fee
for breaking the ground on the burial of a
parishioner.&rdquo;&nbsp; This order was made in consequence of a
dispute upon the point, between the inhabitants and the Vicar,
the Rev. Thomas Hudson.</p>
<p>The oldest tablet in Brighton churchyard is that at the north
of the church, placed&mdash;it being a flat stone,&mdash;to the
memory of Alice, the wife of Richard Masters, who died May, 25th,
1696.&nbsp; It is contiguous to headstones that bear the most
quaint epitaphs in the whole ground.&nbsp; Immediately near it is
that of Mary Sanders, April, 1753, and bears this injunction to
her surviving family:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My loving children, all agree;<br />
Pray live in Love and Unity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tomb next to it is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lyeth Anne ye wife of Richard Halsted, aged
23, and Elizabeth aged 22 years, both daughters of Henry and Mary
Stanbridge, who dyed in May, 1728.</p>
<p>They were two louing sisters,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in this dust now ly, that<br />
Uery day Anne was buryd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Elizabeth did dy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just at this spot, also, a stone points out the last resting
place of the celebrated Sake Deen Mahomed, the introducer of
shampooing into England, in 1784.&nbsp; He died on the 24th of
February, 1851, at the advanced age of 102 years.&nbsp; By the
pathway at the south-east of the chancel are deposited the
remains of Martha Gunn, the royal bather of Brighton, who died
May 2nd, 1815, at the age of 88 years.&nbsp; Her companion of the
bath, Smoaker Miles, is buried near the west boundary wall of the
church-yard, immediately opposite Upper North Street.&nbsp; The
spot is marked by a tombstone, but the inscription has been
wholly obliterated by time.&nbsp; To the east of the stone which
marks Martha Gunn&rsquo;s grave, is the tomb of Swan Downer,
Esq., who endowed the school for girls, known as Swan
Downer&rsquo;s School, and immediately to the west is a large
headstone thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ph&oelig;be Hessel</span>,<br />
Who was born at Stepney, in the Year, 1713.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">She served for many years as a
Private Soldier in the<br />
Fifth Regiment of Foot in different parts of Europe,<br />
and in the year 1745 fought under the command of the<br />
Duke of Cumberland, at the battle of Fontenoy,<br />
Where she received a Bayonet Wound in her Arm.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page104"></a><span

in her latter days.&nbsp; She died at Brighton,<br />
where she had long resided,<br />
December 12th, 1821, aged 108.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remains of Corporal Staines, a marine who fought under
Nelson, at Copenhagen, lie at the foot of old Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
grave.</p>
<p>The following punning epitaph on the headstone, which marks
the spot where rest the remains of a Mr. Law, to the south-west
of the church, has excited particular notice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Stop, Reader! and reflect with awe,<br />
For sin and death have conquered law;<br />
Who, in full hope, resign&rsquo;d his breath,<br />
That grace had conquered sin and death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Law, who was an inhabitant, lost his life by accidentally
walking over the cliff, between the New Steine and the Royal
Crescent.</p>
<p>To the east of the Chancel door a massive stone points out
where are deposited the mortal remains of a great Brighton
celebrity, Captain Tettersell.&nbsp; It is thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">P. M. S.</p>
<p>Captain Nicholas Tettersel, through whose prudenee, ualour,
and loyalty, Charles II., King of England, after he had escaped
the sword of his merciless rebels, and his forces receiued a
fatal ouerthrowe at Worcester, September 3rd, 1651, was
faithfully preserued, and conueyed to France, departed this life
the 26th of July, 1674.</p>
<p>Within this marble monument doth lie<br />
Approved faith, honour, and loyalty;<br />
In this cold clay he has now ta&rsquo;en up his station;<br />
Who once preserued the Church, the Crowne, and Nation;<br />
When Charles the Greate was nothing but a breath,<br />
This ualiant soule stept tweene him and Death:<br />
Usurpers&rsquo; threats, nor tyrant rebels&rsquo; frowne,<br />
Could not affright his duty to the crowne;<br />
Which glorious act of his, for church and state,<br />
Eight princes, in one day did gratulate&mdash;<br />
Professing all to him in debt to bee,<br />
As all the world are to his memory.<br />
Since Earth could not reward the worth him given,<br />
He now receives it from the King of Heaven.<br />
In the same chest one iewel more you have,<br />
The partner of his uirtues, bed, and grave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The special incident referred to in Tettersell&rsquo;s life is
recorded <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>in another part of this book.&nbsp; One of the most
remarkable tombs was that of the Rev. John Bolt, the vicar of
Brighton, who died on the 2nd of November, 1669.&nbsp; It stood
at the north-east corner of the Chancel.&nbsp; Not a vestige of
the tomb now remains.&nbsp; The main structure of it was brick,
and the covering stone was a slab of perriwinkle or Sussex
marble: and so great a curiosity was it that it was in no way
deemed a sacrilege by the casual passer-by, to knock off a piece
with a flint, or even a hammer, for its novelty&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Its final demolition took place in 1853, when that
and other sacred depositories of the dead&mdash;and the remains
of the dead too,&mdash;were ruthlessly removed to enlarge the
church, upon its then restoration.&nbsp; The slab bore the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lies interred the body of Mr. John Bolt,
Master of Arts of Christ College, in Cambridge, aged
seventy-eight years, who was a faithful and laborious preacher of
the Gospel for the space of fifty-six years; whom God had blessed
with <i>twenty-nine</i> children by two wives.&nbsp; He died in
full assurance of a glorious resurrection, on the 2nd day of
November, 1669, and was buried the 7th, likewise of the same
month; in the pious memory of whom, his sorrowful son, <i>Daniel
Bolt</i>, hath erected this monument.</p>

Whatever unto most men pleasant are.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not thy learning nor thy piety<br />
That can secure thee from Death&rsquo;s tyranny.<br />
Witness this learned, pious man of God,<br />
Who fell a victim to his conquering rod.<br />
Nothing but Virtue can outlive our date<br />
That gives a being beyond mortal fate.</p>

<p>The most quaint epitaph was on a slab in the floor just within
the Chancel door.&nbsp; It was nearly obliterated some years
since; but shortly after the present Vicar came to the living, he
had it fresh cut.&nbsp; It, however, with many other relics, was
destroyed during the restoration before mentioned.&nbsp; It
was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh! dear mother, you are gone before,<br />
And I, a wratch, wait at the door:<br />
Sin doth not only keep me thence,<br />
But makes me loath to go from hence.<br />
When Christ hath healed me of my sin,<br />
He&rsquo;ll make me fit and let me in.</p>

106</span>Perhaps the most affecting record of the uncertainty of
life, is that on the tomb of Robert Augustus Bedford.&nbsp; It is
in what is termed the old ground, not far from the poplar tree
which marks the spot where once was a well.&nbsp; This well and a
wall which went direct north to Church Street, formed the west
boundary of a garden that was consecrated as an additional piece
of ground for burial, in January, 1818, by the Bishop of Exeter,
and about that spot was appropriated for the burial of paupers,
and likewise for soldiers; as at that time the Hospital of the
Infantry Barracks occupied the site of the present Hanover Chapel
burial ground.&nbsp; The inscription&mdash;now mostly
obliterated,&mdash;is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This youth, while viewing amidst a large concourse
of persons assembled on the Pier Head of this town, on the 17th
day of July, 1826, some trials designed to show the practibility
of conveying the means of escape to ship-wrecked persons by means
of a chain attached to a ball; from which, on one of the
experiments, it separated on the discharge of the cannon, and
instantaneously deprived him of his life, in the 10th year of his
age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experiment which was being made was that known as Captain
Manby&rsquo;s apparatus for rescuing persons from shipwreck.</p>
<p>On the 20th November, 1819, the funeral of a Sergeant of the
90th foot took place.&nbsp; He was shot on the 17th of the same
month, at the barracks, in Church street, by a private of the
regiment, who, for the offence, was executed at Horsham.</p>
<p>The well here just alluded to, north of the wall which forms
the northern boundary of Queen Square, was, on the restoration of
the church, in 1853, filled up with decayed coffins and the
mortal remains of those whose bodies were disinterred immediately
to the north of the sacred edifice, to afford space and improve
the effect of the building.&nbsp; Amongst those whose narrow cell
was less violated, was that of Sir Richard Phillips, the natural
philosopher, and author of &ldquo;A Million of
Facts.&rdquo;&nbsp; His vault and tomb were reconstructed just
within the south entrance to the cemetery ground, in front of
Clifton Terrace, whither his remains were removed, and where they
now rest.&nbsp; Not far from this tomb lie the remains of Mrs.
Pickstock, the headstone to whose grave is thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">In testimony of the<br
/>

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;I bowed down heavily as one

</blockquote>
<p>To the extreme east of the old ground is the tomb of the real
moderniser of Brighton,&mdash;whose death took place nine and
twenty years ago,&mdash;and is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mr.
Amon Wilds</span>,<br />
Died Sept. 12th 1833, aged 71 years</p>
<p>A remarkable incident accompanies the period at which this
gentleman came to settle in Brighton.&nbsp; Through his abilities
and taste, the order of the ancient architecture of buildings in
Brighton may be dated to have changed from its antiquated
simplicity and rusticity; and its improvements have since
progressively increased.&nbsp; He was a man of extensive genius,
and talent, and in his reputation for uprightness of conduct
could only meet its parallel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contiguous to this tomb, a stone marks the resting-place of a
highly respected inhabitant, for many years the landlord of the
Old Ship Hotel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Leonard Shuckard</span>,<br />
Died 17th January, 1837, aged 70.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately west is the grave of a Brighton celebrity, whose
memory is thus recorded:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">John Jordan</span>,<br />
Many years a respectable hair-dresser of this town.<br />
Died November 13th, 1810.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally the stone was further inscribed:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Say what you will, say
what you can,<br />
John Jordan was an honest man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there appearing a species of levity about these two lines
unbefitting a place of Christian sepulture, they were removed
after the stone had been up but a few days.</p>
<p>To the west of the main entrance from North Street, opposite
Wykeham Terrace, is the vault of Mr. Weiss, formerly a surgical
instrument maker, Charing-cross, London.&nbsp; His remains are
deposited in this vault, his body prior to being screwed down in
the <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>coffin, having, by express desire in his will, been
pierced at the heart by an instrument which he made expressly for
the purpose.&nbsp; His funeral took place with the weapon in him,
a special legacy being left to the surgeon, Mr. Benjamin
Vallance, who complied with the request, for performing the duty,
Mr. Weiss having a dread of being buried alive.</p>
<p>The handsomest monument in the churchyard is that at the
north-east entrance, to the memory of Anna Maria Crouch, formerly
a performer at Drury Lane Theatre.&nbsp; She died Oct. 2nd,
1805.&nbsp; It was erected by Mr. Kelly.</p>
<p>A large stone cross or crucifix formerly stood immediately in
front of the church.&nbsp; The stone steps to it and the lower
fragment of the pillar alone remain.&nbsp; A legend in connexion
with this cross has been preserved, of which the following is a
copy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ST. NICHOLAS
GALLEY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long had raged the bloody feud between the Lords of
Pevensey Castle and the Earls de Warrene, Lords of Lewes; when,
early one bright May morning, the warder of Lewes Castle, from
the northern turret blew loud his horn.&nbsp; The lady of Earl de
Warrene hastened to the turret&rsquo;s height, her infant
first-born son kerchiefed on her arm.&nbsp; From thence she
viewed the dread conflict which was raging with all the fury of
inveterate foes, on Mount Caburn&rsquo;s shelving sides.&nbsp;
Lord Pevensey, on his white steed, was seen leading his followers
down the hill; Earl de Warrene was urging his men to withstand
the charge.&nbsp; In an instant both parties commingled; the
strife was desperate, but of short duration.&nbsp; Lord Pevensey,
having the vantage ground, drove Earl de Warrene&rsquo;s troops
pell-mell down the hill; but the Earl scorned to turn his back
upon his foe, and for some time he singly maintained the conflict
against a host; until Lord Pevensey came up, flushed with
success, and raised his battle-axe to cleave the Earl in
twain.&nbsp; It was at this moment that the noble lady of Earl de
Warrene, seeing her lord in such imminent hazard, held up her
infant son and vowed to Saint Nicholas (the protector of the
faithful in dangers) that if her lord&rsquo;s life was spared his
son should never wed till he had placed the belt worn by the Holy
St. Nicholas, on the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s tomb, at
Byzantium.&nbsp; The saint heard her vow; for the <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Earl
dexterously avoided the blow, and Lord Pevensey, having lost his
balance by the exertion, nearly fell from his horse.&nbsp; In the
next moment the Earl&rsquo;s sword appeared through his cuirass
behind; Lord Pevensey fell dead; his terrified retainers fled in
dismay; and Earl de Warrene returned in triumph to the
Castle.&nbsp; Full twenty summers had now passed over, and
Manfred, Lord of Lewes, the Earl&rsquo;s eldest son, had not yet
fulfilled his mother&rsquo;s vow, to visit the Blessed
Virgin&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; He was betrothed to Lord
Bramber&rsquo;s daughter, the gentle Edona&mdash;beauteous as the
jessamine&rsquo;s bloom&mdash;kind as the Zephyr&mdash;good and
pure as the saints.&nbsp; Full twenty times had the anniversary
of Earl de Warrene&rsquo;s victory been celebrated most gallantly
in the Castle&rsquo;s kingly hall.&nbsp; Again the guests had
assembled there; the wassail bowl went merrily round; the bards
sung in highest strains; Lord Manfred led his betrothed to join
in the mazy dance; when&mdash;whilst all was merriment and
joy,&mdash;suddenly a wintry dismal blast passed through the
hall.&nbsp; The lights were quickly extinguished, the din and
clamour of war seemed to assail the castle walls on every side;
and whilst the guests stood in darkness and in stupid wonder, in
a moment vivid flashes of lightning shot across the richly
tapestried walls, and displayed the fight renewed on Mount
Caburn&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The hill and dale were seen
distinctly, as if broad day were shining, and the combatants
eagerly engaged.&nbsp; But when Lord Pevensey again lifted his
battle-axe to strike Earl de Warrene, all disappeared and total
darkness ensued; the clamour ceased against the castle walls;
lights were brought, but the guests, terrified, gloomily
withdrew.&nbsp; On the morrow, Earl de Warrene hither to
Brighthelmston, to St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Chapel came, and by
the counsel of the holy fathers, built a ship, gaily trimmed, and
named &lsquo;St. Nicholas&rsquo; Galley,&rsquo; to bear his son
to the blessed Virgin&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; It was fixed that when
he should return from performing his noble mother&rsquo;s vow,
then should he wed the fair Edona.&nbsp; The vessel gallantly
dashed from Mecheem <a name="citation109"></a><a
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a> harbour, and
bounded over the yielding wave, making his way for
brighter&mdash;not happier climes.&nbsp; Lord Manfred safely
arrived at Byzantium, and performed his sacred duty.&nbsp; It was
noon on the 17th of happy <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>May&mdash;another year had rolled
its wain&mdash;when a sail, bearing the well known pennant of St.
Nicholas, was descried off Wordinges (Worthing) point by one of
the Fathers of this Chantry.&nbsp; Instantly a messenger was sent
to carry the welcome tidings to Earl de Warrene, who, with all
his retinue, a train of gallant bearing, his noble lady, the Lord
of Bramber with the Lady Edona, and the holy Abbot of the priory,
with all his brotherhood, had, in a few hours, assembled beneath
the Earl&rsquo;s banner, on the hill where now stands St.
Nicholas&rsquo; Church.&nbsp; The day was fair, the wind was
favourable, and the &lsquo;St. Nicholas&rsquo; glided swiftly on
her way; the holy fathers sang with cheerful voices.&nbsp; The
Earl watched, with beaming eyes, for the signal agreed
upon.&nbsp; It was made; shouts rent the air; every face shone
with joy, every heart beat with gratitude; when, in a moment, the
progress of the vessel was checked; she reeled on her side, and
sank before their eyes.&nbsp; She had ran full on the hidden rock
off Shore-ham <a name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a> harbour.&nbsp; The Earl and every
soul around him stood motionless; not a word broke the silence of
that sad scene.&nbsp; To move was useless.&nbsp; One sad, last,
long-drawn sigh burst from Edona, and she fell never more to
rise.&nbsp; The Earl passed his hands over his eyes; dropped his
head on his bosom; no smile ever rested on that face again.&nbsp;
One foreign sailor alone of the hapless crew survived to describe
(feebly indeed) the ecstacy of Lord Manfred when he beheld his
native shores and discerned his father&rsquo;s banner waving on
St. Nicholas&rsquo; hill.&nbsp; Slowly as the cavalcade
descended, each cast a look of despair on that sea which had
swallowed all their hopes.&nbsp; Earl de Warrene survived a few
years only; but before he died he built the church to St.
Nicholas on the hill, to be an everlasting remembrance to all who
go upon the mighty deep not to neglect their vows.&nbsp; Lady
Edona lies under the cross at the entrance to the church, being
the spot where she fell and died; but still, on the anniversary
of that day, &lsquo;St. Nicholas&rsquo; Galley&rsquo; glides at
midnight past the town of Brighthelmston, and is seen from the
cliff by hundreds of the inhabitants, to sink. <a
name="citation110b"></a><a href="#footnote110b"
class="citation">[110b]</a>&nbsp; The Earl leaving no children,
his family became extinct, and the estates passed to the heir,
Lord Arundel, to whom they still belong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>A
very quaint epitaph was (it is now obliterated by age) on the
late sexton of the period:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Richard Jeffery.<br />

<p>When Barb&rsquo;ra died, O Lord, prayed I,<br />

And here we lie a faithful pair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preceding it, on the same stone, was the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the memory

class="smcap">Richard Jeffery</span>;<br />

<p>On the tombstone of a Captain Cook was formerly:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Many a hard tempestuous gale he&rsquo;s known,<br

</blockquote>
<p>From their exposed position, the inscriptions on many of the
tombstones have been erased by the hand of time; nor can one be
found of the many recorded in a Diary, kept in 1778 and 1779, of
the character alluded to.&mdash;&ldquo;Monday, September 7th,
1778.&nbsp; My landlord is persuading his eldest son, and of
course heir apparent, a young prince Crispin, to go to sea.&nbsp;
I desire the father to visit <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the churchyard, and upon various
monuments of youth he may observe the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Parents and Friends, weep not for me,<br />
Tho&rsquo; I was drownded in the sea!&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then, after due deliberation, if he chose to renew his
persuasions he must use his pleasure.&nbsp; The poor man seemed
overwhelmed in thought, and much struck.&nbsp; Perhaps the lad
may suffer no further solicitation on this account, unless his
father should turn out to be a staunch predestinarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the north of the church is a dwarf head-stone, thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the memory of
<span class="smcap">Edmund Borman</span>, who was accidently
killed,<br />
February 11th, 1796&mdash;aged 49 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His death was caused thus:&mdash;He was superintending the
erection of a new flag-staff, for the vane, mentioned in page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page84">84</a></span>, for
Mr. Stephen Poune, the Churchwarden; and having gone aloft,
within the tower, to make everything safe in lowering the remains
of the old flag-staff, he hastened down, to receive it below,
when, just as he emerged from the belfry door, the mass, which
was being lowered, having descended much quicker than he
expected, came down upon him, crushing him fearfully, so that he
died within an hour of the accident.&nbsp; Deceased was bowler to
the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, leader of the ringers
and conductor of the choir at the Church, and, being a person of
good education, a generally useful man.</p>
<p>On the west portion of the ground, the record of the death of
Miss Coupland, who was killed by the fall of a wall, in Church
Street, where the Royal Stables now are, whilst walking to the
Parish Church, to act as bridesmaid at the wedding of a young
friend, cannot fail to be read with interest.&nbsp; The shoes
which she wore on the occasion are still preserved by a member of
her family named Hibben, who worked for her father, the owner of
the premises and smithy, which for so many years formed the
obstruction to the Royal Entrance at the bottom of Church
Street.&nbsp; The epitaph runs:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the memory of

Death does not always warning give,<br />
Therefore be careful how you live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A headstone that stands about the centre of the ground to the
east of the church, and yet bears the name of Lucy Fermor,
formerly had on it the following acrostic, now wholly effaced by
age:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>L ook here, ye gay and giddy throng,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no inscription throughout the whole of the hallowed
grounds, affords a theme for deeper meditation than that which
here follows, associated as it is with marriages, births, and
deaths, through a period of half a century: the plighting of
solemn vows, vows how often broken; the promise of suretiship to
renounce all evil works, a promise how seldom kept; we may rest
in Him, as our hope is this our brother doth, a hope how soon
forgotten!&nbsp; It is <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>upon a head-stone, on the left, just
within the southern entrance to the Old Ground, and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Here lies all that is
mortal of<br />
<span class="smcap">John Pocock</span>,</p>

the last day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">He came to his grave on the 13th of
June, 1846, like a shock of corn cometh in his season, aged
81.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following, which is on a stone by the footway, just south
of the tower, has a melancholy history attached to it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sacred to the Memory of John Rowles, who, in
discharging his duties as a Peace Officer of this Town, was
unfortunately killed by a Wound from a Bayonet, on the 5th Nov.,
1817, Aged 40 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The circumstances were: On Tuesday, the 4th of November, 1817,
a public notice was issued, warning the inhabitants against
illuminating their houses, or celebrating the anniversary of the
Gunpowder Plot, by means of fireworks.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this
prohibition, a number of persons, chiefly boys, assembled on the
Old Steine, at twilight, in the evening of Wednesday, the 5th,
and let off squibs, serpents, crackers, &amp;c.&nbsp; The civil
power, in number 16,&mdash;headboroughs and patrol,&mdash;at the
head of which was Mr. John Williams, the High Constable,
immediately interfered, and took into custody the offenders
against the edict.&nbsp; This sort of warfare lasted until nine
o&rsquo;clock, when a lighted tar-barrel made its
appearance.&nbsp; The authorities espied it, and, after a stout
resistance by the populace, it was captured and
extinguished.&nbsp; Much irritation was engendered in
consequence, and the mob, deprived of their fun, seemed inclined
to mischief, and, the principal object of their displeasure being
the High Constable, they attacked his house, the Baths, which
stood on the site now occupied by the Lion Mansion.&nbsp; Mr.
White, also, in Castle Square, who had made himself very
prominent in the affair, came in for his share of the spleen of
the rioters.&nbsp; Stones were hurled with great violence, and
the windows of their houses were soon smashed in.&nbsp; Greatly
alarmed, Williams sent a message to Mr. Serjeant Runnington, the
resident magistrate, and also to the guard-house at the Infantry
barracks, <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Church Street, demanding the aid of the military.&nbsp;
Several companies of the 21st regiment of Fusileers, who had but
that day arrived in Brighton, marched with fixed bayonets to the
Steine, the avenues to which they quickly occupied.</p>
<p>The Riot Act was read by Serjeant Runnington, and the utmost
dismay prevailed.&nbsp; About this time several squibs being let
off near the soldiery, an attempt was made to capture the
offenders.&nbsp; Dreadful to relate, however, while charging, one
of the military accidentally thrust his bayonet into the body of
Mr. Rowles, a headborough.&nbsp; The steel entered just above the
hip, and, passing through, appeared three inches on the other
side,&mdash;the wound proved to be mortal,&mdash;and the ill
fated man lingered, in the utmost agony, until half-past seven on
Thursday evening, when he died, leaving a pregnant wife and three
infant children to lament his untimely end.&nbsp; Two of the
patrol, Slaughter and Burt, were also so wounded with the stones,
cast by the mob, that they were obliged to be carried home, where
they remained for some time in a very dangerous state.&nbsp; A
woman, also, was wounded in the head with slugs, fired from a
pistol.&nbsp; The disturbance lasted until a late hour of the
night, and the military did not repair to their barracks until
two or three o&rsquo;clock the next morning.</p>
<p>On the following morning, the persons who had been apprehended
for creating the disturbance, were brought before the sitting
magistrates, Mr. Serjeant Runnington and Mr. Hopkins, at the Town
Hall.</p>
<p>The civil power was blamed for calling in the military.&nbsp;
The coroner&rsquo;s inquest on the body of Mr. Rowles, after
having sat eight days, returned a verdict of &ldquo;Wilful
Murder&rdquo; against James Day, the principal, and John
Williams, High Constable, and James White, stationer, general
collector of rates, as accessories before the act.&nbsp; They
surrendered to their bail at the Horsham Assizes, on the 25th
March, and were found &ldquo;Not Guilty,&rdquo; and the judge
said, that, so far from any blame being attached to Williams and
White, he was fully persuaded that they had acted throughout with
the greatest prudence, coolness, and discretion. <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>The
base of the stone cross, to which is attached the legend of St.
Nicholas Galley, is a remnant of the superstition that prevailed
prior to the Reformation.&nbsp; In primitive times, the south
side of every churchyard contained a column placed on a pedestal,
having on its summit a cross; and the nearer to this a corpse was
interred, so much the sooner&mdash;it was believed&mdash;would
the soul be relieved from purgatory.&nbsp; Hence the reason why
the south side of a churchyard most frequently contains the
greatest number of interments, individuals having a solemn dread
of being buried in the north, where there was no cross.&nbsp; So
far, indeed, did primitive Christians carry their devotion for
this figure, that they have been accused of worshipping the cross
itself.&nbsp; Such was their blind zeal for the sign of the
cross, that they violated all bounds of prudence, and Flecknoe
quaintly observes:&mdash;&ldquo;That had they their will, a bird
should not fly in the air with its wings <i>a-cross</i>, a ship
with its <i>cross-yard</i> sail upon the sea, nor profane tailor
sit <i>cross-legged</i> upon his shop-board, or have
<i>cross-bottoms</i> to wind his thread upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With reference to the particular pillar in question, no
records, beyond the legend, exist which might contribute to the
solution of its origin, but the probability is that it was
erected about the seventh century, when the mania for columns and
crosses prevailed.</p>
<p>The New Burial Ground, as it is termed, was added in 1824; and
the Cemetery Ground was opened in what was known as Butcher
Russell&rsquo;s field, in 1841, the first burial in it being that
of Mary Wheeler, the wife of a labourer, who was employed in
laying out and levelling the ground.&nbsp; She died June 27th,
1841, and an obelisk marks her grave.</p>
<p>At the time when grave-yard robbers, termed Resurrectionists,
were the dread of surviving relatives, in 1820&ndash;21, these
desecrators of the silent tomb paid the Old Churchyard a visit,
in the autumn <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>of the former year, and conveyed away at least one
body, the chief of the sacrilegious wretches being Williams, who,
in 1831, was executed at Newgate, with Bishop, for
&ldquo;Burking&rdquo; an Italian boy.&nbsp; The circumstance of
the body being stolen greatly alarmed the inhabitants, and for
many years afterwards it was the constant practice to have
watchers, under a species of impromptu tent, night after night,
for months together, upon the death of a person, to prevent the
body from being conveyed away.&nbsp; At one period the system of
watching had become such a nuisance that persons were afraid to
venture through the burial ground after dusk&mdash;the time when
the watchers went on duty&mdash;as the parties were not satisfied
with being there to scare off the expected marauders, but they
took with them creature comforts in the form of beer, spirits,
and tobacco, and armed themselves with pistols, guns, and swords,
so that, when the alcoholic spirits began to rise, there was a
great lack of discretion, and frequent broils in consequence
ensued.&nbsp; The churchwardens, therefore, interfered and
prevented their having any other arms than stout sticks.&nbsp;
This reckless and indecent profanation of the sacred dormitory
lamentably recalls to one&rsquo;s mind the vitiated taste and
customs of the early ages, when churchyards were no sooner
enclosed than they were appropriated as places of public
amusement.&nbsp; According to Aubrey, &ldquo;in every parish was
a church-house, to which belonged spits, crocks, and other
utensils, for dressing provisions.&nbsp; Here the housekeepers
met, the young people were there, too, and had dancing, bowling,
shooting at butts, &amp;c., the ancients gravely sitting by and
looking on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fosbrook further informs us, that
&ldquo;Whitsun ales were brewed by the churchwardens, and sold in
the church; and the profits&mdash;there being no rates for the
relief of the poor&mdash;were distributed amongst
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, also, customary for barbers to come
and shave the parishioners in the churchyard on Sundays and high
festivals, before matins.&nbsp; This liberty continued till 1422,
when it was restrained by a particular prohibition of Richard
Flemyng, Bishop of Lincoln.</p>
<p>For more than ten years the custom of watching prevailed; but
legislation at length suggested a means of supplying subjects for
dissection, without despoiling the graves; and, since then, in
1851, intra-mural burials being prohibited, the Brighton
Churchyards <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>have been respected, and on the 17th of November, 1859,
the first tree was planted in the oldest ground, near Wykeham
Terrace, by Mr. Churchwarden Marchant, who had suggested the
plantation of the grounds.&nbsp; Other of the authorities and the
inhabitants in general, followed his example, and very soon the
planting of some hundreds of trees and shrubs was effected; but
as yet the vegetation of them has progressed but slowly. <a

MARTYRDOM OF DERYK <a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a> CARVER.</h2>
<p>Deryk Carver, a brewer, the proprietor of what is now known as
the Black-Lion Street Brewery, the oldest building in the town, a
Fleming by birth, who had been resident in Brighton about eight
or nine years, was the first who suffered martyrdom in Sussex,
under the persecution of Mary.&nbsp; About the end of October,
1554, Carver, <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>who had adopted the doctrines of the Reformation, and
had been in the habit, as opportunity offered, of collecting a
few people of his own persuasion in his house, for the purpose of
religious worship, was, together with John Launder, of Godstone,
apprehended, as they were at prayer, by Edward Gage, of Firle, a
gentleman and county Magistrate, and sent up to the Queen&rsquo;s
Council.&nbsp; After examination, he and his friend were sent
prisoners to Newgate, to await the leisure of Bishop Bonner for
his further examination into their heretical practices.&nbsp; The
Bishop interrogated them on matters of faith, on the 8th of June
following, so that they must have lain in prison for more than
seven months, upon a mere suspicion.&nbsp; They made certain
confessions, which they duly signed, and then the Bishop, who had
no legal right whatever to meddle with their creed, as they were
not of his diocese, objected against them certain articles, in
the ordinary course of ecclesiastical law, as it existed in those
days.&nbsp; Various means were resorted to to induce Carver and
Launder to recant, but these they stedfastly resisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will never go from these answers,&rdquo; said the
latter, &ldquo;so long as I live,&rdquo; and so said
Carver.&nbsp; Wherefore, on the 10th of June, two days
afterwards, they were cited to the Consistory Court of St.
Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The &ldquo;confession&rdquo; of Carver, as
preserved in Fox&rsquo;s Acts and Monuments, was in substance
this: &ldquo;I. That the bread and wine used in the Holy
Communion, or as it was then called, the &lsquo;Sacrament of the
Altar,&rsquo; is simply bread and wine, and not the material body
and blood of Christ.&nbsp; II. That the mass is not a sacrifice;
that it does not conduce to salvation; and that it is not
profitable to a Christian man, because it is said in Latin, a
tongue which he, with the majority of the people, does not
understand.&nbsp; III. That although it is requisite to go to a
good priest for counsel in matters of religion, yet that
priest&rsquo;s absolution is not profitable for a man&rsquo;s
salvation.&nbsp; IV. That the faith and religion now set forth in
the Church of England is not agreeable to God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp;
That Bishops Hooper, Cardmaker, Rogers, and others of their
opinion were good Christian men, and did preach the true doctrine
of Christ, and that they did shed their blood in the same
doctrine, by the power of God.&nbsp; V. That since the
Queen&rsquo;s coronation he hath had the bible and psalter in
English read in his house at <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Brighthampsted divers times, and
likewise, since his coming into Newgate, but the keeper thereof
did take them away; and also that about a twelvemonth now past he
had the English procession said in his house with other English
prayers.&nbsp; And further, that Thomas Iveson, John Launder, and
William Veisie, prisoners within Newgate, were taken with this
examinate in his house at Brighthampsted, as they were hearing of
the Gospel, then read in English.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
&ldquo;confession&rdquo; of John Launder states, among other
things, that he was a husbandman, twenty-five years of age, and
an inhabitant of Godstone, and that himself, with Carver, Iveson,
Veisie, and other persons, to the number of twelve, had been
apprehended by Mr. Gage, in Carver&rsquo;s house, as they were
saying the service in English, as set forth in the days of King
Edward the Sixth.&nbsp; It appears that Launder, having come down
to Brighton to transact business for his father, had heard of
Carver&rsquo;s zeal for the Gospel, and had been to his house for
religious worship, at the time of Mr. Gage&rsquo;s unfriendly
visit.&nbsp; The confession winds up with a statement of his
religious views, which, in the main, are identical with
Carver&rsquo;s own, as stated.&nbsp; The Bishop&rsquo;s Articles,
twelve in number, reiterated the charges already adduced against
the prisoners, who, being asked if they still adhered to their
opinions, replied affirmatively.&nbsp; Carver added &ldquo;your
doctrine is poison and sorcery.&nbsp; If Christ were here you
would put Him to a worse death than He was put to before.&nbsp;
You say that you can make a God: ye can make a pudding as
well.&nbsp; Your ceremonies in the Church be beggary and
poison.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bishop, seeing their constancy,
pronounced judgment upon them both, whereupon they were delivered
to the Sheriffs, who were then present, in order that they might
be burnt in due course of law.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Dirricke&rdquo;
records Fox, &ldquo;was a man, whom the Lorde had blessed as well
with temporall ryches, as with his spirituall treasures, which
ryches yet were no clogge or let unto his true professing of
Christ, the Lord, by His grace, so working in him; of the which,
there was such havock, by the gready raveners of that time, that
his poore wyfe and children had little or none thereof.&nbsp;
During his imprisonment, although he was well stricken in yeares
(and, as it were, past the tyme of learning), yet he so spent his
tyme, that being, at hys first <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>apprehension, utterly ignoraunt of
anye letter of the booke, hee coulde, before his death, read
perfectly any printed English.&nbsp; Whose diligence and zeale is
worthy no small commendation, and therefore I thought it good not
to let passe over in silence, for the good encouragement and
example of others.&nbsp; Moreover, at his comming into the town
of Lewes to be burned, the people called upon him, beseechying
God to strengthen hym in the faith of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He
thanked them, and prayed unto God, that of Hys mercy he would
strengthen <i>them</i> in the lyke faith.&nbsp; And when hee came
to the signe of the Starre, the people drew near unto him, where
the Sheriffe sayd that he had found him a faithfull man in al his
aunswers.&nbsp; And as he came to the stake, he kneeled downe and
made his prayers, and the Sheriffe made hast.&nbsp; Then hys
booke was throwen into the barrel, and when he had strypt him
sclfe (as a joyfull member of God) he went into the (pitch)
barrel him selfc.&nbsp; And as soone as ever he came in, he tooke
up the booke and threw it among the people, and then the Sheriffe
commaunded in the Kyng and Queen&rsquo;s name, on paine of death,
to throw in the booke againe.&nbsp; And immediately, that
faithfull member spake with a joyfull voyce,
saying:&mdash;&lsquo;Deare brethren and sistern, wytness to you
all that I am come to seale with my blood Christes Gospell, for
because I know that it is true; it is not unknowen unto al you,
but that it hath bene truly preached here in Lewes, and in all
places in England, and now it is not.&nbsp; And for because that
I wyll not denye here God&rsquo;s Gospell, and be obedient to
man&rsquo;s lawes, I am condemned to dye.&nbsp; Dere brethren and
sistern, as many of you as do beleve upon the Father, the Soune,
and the Holye Ghost, unto everlasting lyfe, see you doe the
workes appertaining to the same.&nbsp; And as many of you as do
beleve upon the Pope of Rome, or any of hys lawes, which he sets
forth in these daies, you do beleve to your utter condemnation,
and except the great mercy of God, you shall burne in hell
perpetually.&rsquo;&nbsp; Immediately the Sheriffe spake unto
him, and sayd: &lsquo;if thou docst not beleve on the Pope, thou
art <i>damned</i> body and soule!&rsquo;&nbsp; And farther the
Sheriffe sayd unto him, &lsquo;speake to thy God, that He may
deliver thee now, or els to strike me down to the example of this
people;&rsquo; but this faithfull member said, &lsquo;the Lord
forgive you your sayings.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then spake hee <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>againe to
all the people there present, with a loude voice, saying:
&lsquo;deare brethren, and all you whom I have offended in wordes
or in dede, I aske you for the Lorde&rsquo;s sake to forgeve me,
and I hartly forgeve all you, which have offended me in thought,
word, or dede.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he sayd further in his prayer,
&lsquo;Oh Lorde my God, thou hast written: He that will not
forsake wife, children, house, and all that he hath, and take up
Thy cross and follow Thee, is not worthy of Thee.&nbsp; But thou
Lorde knowest that I have forsaken all to come unto Thee; Lorde
have mercy upon me, for unto Thee I commend my spirit, and my
soule doth rejoyce in thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; These were the last
wordes of that faithfull member of Christ before the fire was put
to him.&nbsp; And afterward that the fire came to him he cried,
&lsquo;Oh Lord have mercy upon me,&rsquo; and sprong up in the
fire, calling upon the name of Jesus, and so ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order of the Sheriff, that the people should throw
Carver&rsquo;s bible into the fire, does not appear to have been
complied with, as the book is still preserved, and is in the
possession of Mr. Ade, Colonnade, North Street.&nbsp; It is what
is termed, a &ldquo;breeches&rdquo; bible, from the circumstance
that in Genesis iii., 7, the words are:
&ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash;meaning Adam and Eve&mdash;&ldquo;sewed
figge leaves together, and made themselves
&lsquo;breeches,&rsquo;&rdquo; other translations being
&ldquo;aprons.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in a state of good
preservation, but the title page is gone, hence its date cannot
be correctly known; but on comparing it with others of apparently
the like edition,&mdash;an imperial octavo,&mdash;it was
published in 1550.&nbsp; It received but little injury from the
action of the fire upon it; merely a slight discolouration on
some of the pages, from the smoke; but the following engrossed
memorandum on a blank half-page, between Malachi and the
Apocrypha, proves that it is not in the same binding now as it
was when Carver had it:</p>

vital fluid.&nbsp; Altogether, the Bible is a very precious
relic, and its present possessor attaches to it great value, he
having refused large sums of money that have been offered him for
it.</p>
<p>Stephen Gratwicke, a Brighton man of respectable family, and

priest suborned to personate the Bishop of Chichester, he
expostulated with his judges for keeping men a year or two in
prison, &ldquo;permittyng them not so much as a Testament to look
upon, for their soules comfort.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this the Bishop
of Winchester replied:&mdash;&ldquo;No, syr, we will use you as
we will use the child, for if the child will hurt himself with a

THE ESCAPE OF CHARLES II.</h2>
<p>After the defeat at Worcester, on the 3rd of September, 1651,
Charles II., on his arrival at Kidderminster, by the advice of
the Earl of Derby, and under the guidance of Francis Yates,
brother-in-law of Penderell, retired to &ldquo;Boscobel,&rdquo; a
lone house on the borders of Staffordshire, where lived one
Richard Penderell, a farmer, and his four brothers.&nbsp; By the
aid of the Penderells, Charles clothed himself in the garb of a
peasant, and carried a bill-hook with him into the woods, where
daily he pretended to be employed cutting faggots.&nbsp; His only
attendant at that time was Colonel Careless, a Roman
Catholic.&nbsp; The suspicion of the Parliamentary army was,
however, aroused by two strangers staying at such a lone place as
Boscobel, and detachments of troops were, in consequence, sent in
search of them, and it was then that Charles and Colonel Careless
hid themselves in the branches of an oak tree.&nbsp; By the
assistance of a Benedictine monk, named Hudleston, Lord Wilmot
then joined the King, and by his proposition, they, with
Penderell, repaired, at night, to the house of a Mr. Whitegrave,
a Catholic gentleman residing some distance from Boscobel.&nbsp;
The King, in relating his escape, used to say that the rustling
of Richard&rsquo;s calf-skin breeches was the best guide for him
during the dark night&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; Here they were pursued
by the parliamentarian army; and Colonel Lane, at whose house
Lord Wilmot had been concealed, being made acquainted with the
critical position of Charles, offered to conceal him in his house
at Bentley.&nbsp; From there he retired to Bristol, at the house
of Mr. Norton, a kinsman of Colonel Lane, in the hope of being
able to obtain a passage to the continent, as
&ldquo;William,&rdquo; the servant to Miss Jane Lane (sister of
Colonel Lane), but no vessel would leave there for a month.&nbsp;
Charles, being thus frustrated in his object, placed himself
under the guardianship of Colonel Windham, of Dorsetshire, in
whose charge he continued nine days, and then went to Heale,
within three miles of Salisbury, where he remained until the
necessary arrangements had been made by Lord Wilmot, for his
passage from Brighthelmston to France.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Lord
Wilmot, after receiving counsel from Dr. Hinchman, afterwards
Bishop of Salisbury, tried at Lawrence Hyde&rsquo;s Esq., living
at Hinton Dambray, in Hampshire, near the sea, what could be done
for a passage.&nbsp; Being unsuccessful there, he repaired to
Colonel George Gounter, at Rackton, four miles from Chichester,
who promised him every assistance in his power.&nbsp; On
Wednesday, the 8th of October, the Colonel rode to Elmsworth
(Emsworth), a fishing station two miles from Rackton; but as the
boats were all away, the Colonel could do no good there.&nbsp;
Colonel Gounter then, accompanied by Lord Wilmot, rode to
Langstone, a place by the sea, and attempted in vain to arrange
for a passage.&nbsp; Colonel Gounter and Lord Wilmot then
received the co-operation of Captain Thomas Gounter, who went to
Chichester, but was unsuccessful in his object.&nbsp; The Colonel
upon this, conceived the next and best expedient, namely, of
treating with a French merchant, a Mr. Francis Mancell, at
Ovingdean Grange, whither he hastened, pretending to pay him a
visit, and to become well acquainted with him.&nbsp; He was there
courteously received, and entertained; and, after a while, he
broke the business to Mancell, saying, &ldquo;I do not only come
to visit you; but to request one favour of you.&nbsp; I have two
special friends who have been engaged in a duel, and there is
mischief done, and I am obliged to get them off if I can.&nbsp;
Can you fraught (freight) a bark?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Mancell said
he doubted not he could at Brighthelmston.&nbsp; The Colonel
pressed him to go immediately, promising, if the business was
effected he would give him &pound;50 for his pains; but it being
Stock fair-day there, and his partner out of the way, he could
not possibly until the next day.&nbsp; On the 10th October, the
merchant went to Brighthelmston to enquire, but the seaman upon
whom he could with the greatest certainty have depended, was gone
to Chichester, he having bargained for a cargo there;
fortunately, however, it touched at Shoreham, about four miles
from Brighthelmston.&nbsp; Mr. Mancell, therefore, sent
immediately to Shoreham, for the man, and on Saturday the 11th
October, an agreement was made that he (the seaman), should have
&pound;60 paid him, before he took the parties into the
boat.&nbsp; And it was arranged that he was to be in readiness at
an hour&rsquo;s warning.&nbsp; In the meantime, Mancell was to
stay there, under pretence of freighting his <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>bark, so as
to see all things in readiness against the arrival of the Colonel
and his two friends.&nbsp; The Colonel then returned to the house
of Mr. Hyde, afterwards Chief Justice of the King&rsquo;s Bench,
with whom Lord Wilmot was staying, and broke the joyful
intelligence to him, that all was in readiness; and it was
arranged that Colonel Phillips should go for the King on the
following day.&nbsp; This was effected, and the King, on
horseback, escorted by Colonel Phillips, rode from Heale to
Winchester, where they were met by Lord Wilmot, Colonel Gounter,
and Captain Gounter, who accompanied them to Brawde Halfe-penny,
a little above Hambledon, where Charles expressed a wish that
lodgings should be procured in the neighbourhood, and he was
consequently conducted to the house of Colonel Phillips&rsquo;s
sister, at the rear of Hambledon; where, after partaking of a
hearty supper, Charles retired to rest, being much fatigued by
his long ride of 40 miles that day.&nbsp; At the break of day the
following morning, the party took their leave of Hambledon, and
on coming to Arundel, rode close by the castle, where they were
met full butt by Captain Morley, the Governor, but whom they
happily escaped, and then passed on by Howton to Bramber.&nbsp;
The remaining portion of the journey is found thus fully detailed
in a very curious and <i>recherche</i> article which, about forty
years since came into the possession of the British Museum, and
is entitled &ldquo;The last Act, in the miraculous storie of his
Mties. escape; being a true and perfect revelation of his
conveyance, through many dangers, to a safe harbour; out of the
reach of his tyranical enemies; by Colonel Gunter; of Racton in
Sussex; who had the happiness to be instrumental in the business,
(as it was taken from his mouth by a person of worth a little
before his death.)&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Being come to Bramber, we
found the streets full of soldiers, on both sides the houses;
whoe unluckily and unknowne to me were come thither the night
before, to guard; but luckily (or rather by a speciall
Providence) were just then come from their guard at Bramber
bridge, unto the towne <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a> for
refreshment.&nbsp; We came upon them unawares, and were seen,
before we suspected anything.&nbsp; My Lord Wilmot was ready to
turne back, when I stept in and said: &lsquo;If we do, wee are
undone.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He saith well,&rsquo; saith the
King.&nbsp; I went before, hee followed, and soe <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>passed
through, without any hinderance.&nbsp; It was then betweene three
and fower of the clock in the afternoone.&nbsp; We went on; but
had not gone farre, but a new terror pursued us; the same
soldiers riding after us as fast as they could.&nbsp; Whereupon
the King gave me a hem!&nbsp; I slacked my pase, till they were
come upp to me and by that tyme, the soldiers were come, whoe
rudely passed by us (beeing in a narrow lane) soe that we could
hardly keepe our saddles for them; but passed by without any
further hurt; being some 30 or 40 in number.&nbsp; When we were
come to Beeding, a little village where I had provided a
treatment for the King (one Mr. Bagshall&rsquo;s house) I was
earnest that his Matie. should stay there a whyle, till he had
viewed the coast: But my Lord Wilmot would by noe meanes, for
feare of those soldiers, but carried the King out of the road, I
knew not whither, soe we parted; they were they thought safest, I
to Brightemston; being agreed they should send to me, when fixed
any where, and ready.&nbsp; Being come to the said Brightemston,
I found all clear there, and the Inne (the George) free from all
strangers att that tyme.&nbsp; Having taken the best roome in the
house and bespoken my supper; as I was entertaining myselfe with
a glass of wine; the King, not finding accommodation elsewhere to
his mind was come to the Inne; then upp comes mine hoast (one
Smith by name).&nbsp; &lsquo;More guests,&rsquo; saith he; he
brought them into another room, I taking noe notice.&nbsp; It was
not long, but drawing towards the King&rsquo;s roome, I heard the
King&rsquo;s voice, saying aloud to Lord Wilmot, &lsquo;Here, Mr.
Barlow, I drinck to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know that
name&rsquo; said I to my hoast, there by me; &lsquo;I pray
enquire, and whether he were not a Major in the King&rsquo;s
Army.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which done, he was found to bee the man, whome
I expected; and presently invited, as was likely, to the
fellowship of a glass of wine.&nbsp; From that I proceeded and
made a motion to join companie, and because my chamber was
largest that they might make use of it.&nbsp; Which was accepted,
and soe we became one companie againe.&nbsp; At supper the King
was cheereful, not showing the least signe of fear or
apprehension of danger; neyther then nor att any tyme during the
whole course of this busines.&nbsp; Which is no small wonder,
considering that the very thought of his ennemies soe great, and
soe many; soe diligent, and soe much interested in his ruine; was
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>enough,
as long as he was within their reach, and as it were, in the very
middest of them, to have daunted the stoutest courage in the
world.&nbsp; As if God had opened his eyes, as he did
Elisha&rsquo;s servant, at his master&rsquo;s request, and he had
seene a heavenly hoast round about him to guard him: which to us
was visible, who therefore, though much encouraged by his
undauntedness, and the assurance of soe good and glorious a
cause; yet were not without secret terrors within ourselves, and
thought every minute a day, a month, till they should see his
sacred person out of their reach.&nbsp; Supper ended, the King
stood his back against the fyer, leaning over a chaire.&nbsp; Up
comes mine host (upon some jealousie, I guess not any certain
knowledge;) but up comes him who called himself Gaius, runs to
the King, catcheth his hand and kissing it, said: &lsquo;It shall
not be said but I have kissed the best man&rsquo;s hand in
England.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had waited at table at supper, where the
boateman also sate with us and were then present.&nbsp; Whether
he had feare, or heard any thing that could give him any occasion
of suspicion, I knowe not.&nbsp; In very decde, the King had a
hard taske, soe to carry himself in all things, that he might be
in nothing like himselfe: Majesty being so naturall upon him,
that even when hee said nothing, did nothing, his very lookes (if
a man observed) were enough to betray him.&nbsp; It was admirable
to see the King (as though he had not been concerned in these
words, which might have soumded in the ears of another man as the
sentence of death) turned about in silence, without any
alteration of countenance or taking notice of what had been
said.&nbsp; About a quarter of an hour after, the King went to
his chamber, where I followed him and craved his pardon with
earnest protestation that I was innocent, soe altogether ignorant
of the cause how this had hapened.&nbsp; &lsquo;Peace, peace,
Colonel,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;the fellow knowes mee, and
I him.&nbsp; He was one (whether or not, I know not; soe the King
thought att the tyme) that belonged to the back stairs of my
father; I hope he is an honest fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this I
began to treat with the boatman (Tettersfield by name) asking him
in what readiness he was.&nbsp; He answered, he could not of that
night, because for more security he had brought his vessel into a
breake and the tyde had forsaken it: so that it was on
ground.&nbsp; It is observable that all the whyle this business
had been in agitation <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>to this very time, the wind had been
contrarie.&nbsp; The king then opening the wenddowe, tooke notice
that the wind was turned, and told the master of the shipp.&nbsp;
Whereupon, because of the wind, and a cleere night, I offered
&pound;10 more to the man to gett off that night.&nbsp; But that
could not be.&nbsp; However, we agreed that he should take in his
company that night.&nbsp; But it was a great business that we had
in hand; and God would have us to knowe soe, both by the
difficulties that offered themselves, and by his helpe he
afforded to remove them.&nbsp; When we thought we had agreed, the
boatman starts back and saith, &lsquo;noe, except I would ensure
the barke.&rsquo;&nbsp; Argue it we did with him, how
unresoanable it was, beeing soe well paid, &amp;c., but to no
purpose, soe that I yielded att last, and &pound;200 was his
valuation, which was agreed upon.&nbsp; But then, as though he
had been resolved to frustrate all by unreasonable demands, he
required my bond.&nbsp; At which, moved with much indignation, I
began to be as resolut as he; saying, among other things,
&lsquo;there were more boates to bee had, besydes his; if he
would not another should,&rsquo; and made as though I would go to
another.&nbsp; In this contest the king happily interposed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He saith right,&rsquo; saith his Matie., &lsquo;a
gentleman&rsquo;s word, especially before witnesses, is as good
as his bond.&rsquo;&nbsp; At last the man&rsquo;s stomach came
downe, and carrie them he would, whatever became of it; and
before he would be taken he would run his boate under the
water.&nbsp; Soe it was agreed that about tooe in the morning
they should be aboard.&nbsp; The boateman in the meanetyme went
to provide for necessaries, and I persuaded the king to take some
rest.&nbsp; He did, in his cloaths, and my Lord Wilmot with him,
till towards tooe in the morning.&nbsp; Then I called them up,
showing them how the tyme went by my watch.&nbsp; Horses being
ledd by the back way towards the beache, we came to the boat, and
found all readie.&nbsp; Soe I took my leave, craving his Maties.
pardon if anthing had happened through error, not want of will or
loyalty.&nbsp; How willingly I would have waited further, but for
my family (being many) which would want mee, and I hoped his
Matie. would not, not doubting but in a very little tyme he
should be where he would.&nbsp; My only request to his Mtie. was
that he would conceal his instruments, wherein their preservation
was so much concerned.&nbsp; His Matie. promised noebody <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>should
know.&nbsp; I abided there keeping the horses in readiness in
case anything unexpected had happened.&nbsp; At 8 o&rsquo;clock I
saw them on sayle, and it was the afternoon before they were out
of sight.&nbsp; The wind (O Providence) held very good till the
next morning, to ten of the clock brought them to a place of
Normandie called Fackham, some three miles from Havre de Grace,
15 Oct.&nbsp; Wenseday.&nbsp; They were no sooner landed but the
wind turned, and a violent storme did arise, in soe much that the
boateman was forced to cut his cable, lost his anchor to save his
boate, for which he required of me &pound;8, and had it.&nbsp;
The boate was back againe at Chichester, by Friday, to take his
fraught.&nbsp; I was not gone out of the town of Brighthelmston
twoe houres, but soldiers came thither to search for a tall man 6
foot and 4 inches high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the foregoing it will be seen that Charles never visited,
much less slept at Ovingdean Grange, as has been stated by some
historical writers, playwrights, and writers of romance. <a
name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130"
class="citation">[130]</a></p>
<p>The vessel in which Charles escaped, was the
&ldquo;Surprise,&rdquo; the property of Captain Nicholas
Tettersell, whose virtues are engraved upon his tomb in the Old
Church-yard,&mdash;<i>vide</i> Chapter XVI.&nbsp; The vessel was
a brig which had been detained a few years previously, in the
Downs, by a royal squadron, on her way from Newcastle, with a
cargo of coals, but was released by a personal order of Charles,
then Prince of Wales, whose features were consequently known to
Tettersell, notwithstanding the king&rsquo;s attempt to disguise
himself.&nbsp; The brig at the time of the engagement with
Tettersell, was half laden with coals, and the sailors were in a
great measure disengaged from duty.&nbsp; In order, therefore, to
collect them without exciting suspicion, he announced that she
had broken from her moorings.&nbsp; By this means, having got his
crew on board, he signified to them his engagement in a secret
expedition, in which their service should not go
unrewarded.&nbsp; Matters being thus prudently adjusted,
Tettersell went ashore by himself, in order to get a bottle of
spirits, and to inform his wife that he should be <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>absent for
a few days.&nbsp; Curiosity urging the good woman to dive into
the mystery of so sudden and unreasonable a departure, he was at
last constrained by her importunity to reveal to her the nature
of the service he had undertaken; and she, with a fortitude and
fidelity which reflect a lustre on her memory, earnestly exhorted
him to an honourable performance of his engagement with the
illustrious fugitive.&nbsp; It is recorded by Baker, in his
Chronicles, that in the course of the day, as the king, who still
retained his disguise, that of a Puritan, was sitting on the
deck, one of the sailors stood close to windward of him smoking
his pipe, and on being rebuked by the captain for making so free,
retired, muttering, &ldquo;truly a cat may look at a king,&rdquo;
but without being aware how personally apposite the adage
was.</p>
<p>After the Restoration, Tettersell, in 1671, in consideration
of his loyal services, was appointed by James, Duke of York,
(then Lord High Admiral of England,) Captain of the &ldquo;Royal
Escape,&rdquo; as a fifth-rate; and the year ensuing, the king
granted the reversion of that sinecure to his son.</p>
<p>The following is the patent for the reversion of the
appointment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> R.</p>
<p>Whereas our dear brother, James, Duke of York, Lord High
Admiral of England, hath by his orders, dated the 4th of
September last past, directed you to cause Captain Nicholas
Tetershall to be borne in pay, together with one servant, as
captain of our vessel called the Royal Escape; and that he should
be allowed pay as captain of a fifth-rate ship, and he and his
servant paid with the yard at Deptford; and whereas the said
Nicholas Tetershall hath humbly besought us to continue the said
allowance unto his son, Nicholas Tetershall, after his decease,
in consideration of his faithful and fortunate service performed
unto us, we have thought fit to condescend unto that his request,
and it is accordingly our will and pleasure that after the
decease of the said Nicholas Tetershall, the father, he, the said
Nicholas Tetershall, the son, be borne in pay, together with one
servant, as captain of our said vessel, the Royal Escape, and
that he be allowed pay as captain of a fifth-rate ship, and he
and his servant paid with the yard at Deptford, in the same
manner as his father now is.&nbsp; Given at our Court at
Whitehall, the 29th day of August, 1672, in the
four-and-twentieth year of our reign.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">By His Majesty&rsquo;s command,<br
/>
<span class="smcap">Henry Coventry</span>.</p>
<p>To the Principal Officers and Commissioners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of our Navy now and the time
being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the following minute in the record book of the House of <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Commons,
Wednesday, 19th of December, 1660, it will be seen that His
Majesty was not unmindful of the services in effecting his
escape, that were rendered by Mr. Lane and his family:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Resolved</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;That as a mark of
respect to Mrs. Lane, and in testimony of her services, in being
instrumental to the preservation and security of the person of
his royal Majesty, there be conferred on the said Mrs. Lane the
sum of &pound;1,000, to buy her a jewel, and that the same be,
and hereby stands charged on the arrears of the grand excise, and
paid to her assigns, in course, after the other sums are
satisfied which are charged on the grand excise, by former orders
of this Parliament.&nbsp; And the commissioners of excise, for
the time being, are hereby impowered and required to satisfy and
pay the same accordingly.&nbsp; And this order, together with the
acquitance of the said Mrs. Lane, or her assigns, testifying the
receipt thereof, shall be to the commissioners of excise a
sufficient warrant and discharge.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And letters patent, bearing date, 12th day of July, Anno 1677,
were granted by the king, to John Lane of Bentley, in the County
of Stafford, that henceforth he and his lawful descendants shall
bear in augmentation of their fraternal arms, <i>three lyons
passant guardant</i>, <i>or in a Canton Gu</i>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Royal Escape&rdquo; was Tettersell&rsquo;s
coal-brig ornamented and enlarged; and shortly after the
Restoration, she was moored in the Thames, opposite Whitehall, to
receive the veneration of the fickle multitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
some time after,&rdquo; as Dunvan says, &ldquo;when the
increasing guilt of Charles proved to them a bitter restorative
from political insanity, she dropped down to Deptford, where she
remained in a progressive state of decay, till, in the year 1791,
her mouldering remains were broken up for fuel in one of the
dockyards there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The descendants of Tettersell long enjoyed an annual pension
of &pound;100.&nbsp; Sir John Bridger, the grandfather of Sir
Henry Shiffner, of Combe Place, was the last of the family who
received the pension.&nbsp; A ring which was given to Tettersell
by Charles, is in the possession of the Shiffner family.</p>
<p>The name of the Inn, in West street, was, after the return of
Charles from exile, changed from the &ldquo;George&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; and as a memorial of the royal
visit, the portrait of his Majesty became the sign of the
house.&nbsp; It remained some years fixed on the outside of the
premises; but about forty years since, when it was going rapidly
to decay, it was taken down by the then <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>landlord,
Mr. Eales, and, having received a coat of varnish, was placed in
an oak frame and hung up indoors.&nbsp; That, however, like every
other memento of the flight of Charles, has some years been a
thing of the past, the bedstead with its appurtenances whereon
the royal personage slept, the chair whereon he sat, the cooking
apparatus of the occasion, and every article connected with the
event having long since been purchased at long prices to those
persons who set store upon historical relics.&nbsp; On Royal Oak
Day, the anniversary of the 29th of May, 1660, commonly called
Restoration Day, it is customary for a large bough of oak to
adorn the front of the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only relic in Brighton, in any way connected with the
&ldquo;Merrie Monarch,&rdquo; is Nell Gwynne&rsquo;s
looking-glass.&nbsp; This glass is amongst the curiosities in the
Brighton Museum, at the Royal Pavilion, and is the property of
Sir Charles Dick, of Port Hall, Dyke Road, Brighton.&nbsp; It
bears the likeness of Nell Gwynne and King Charles, which are
modelled in wax; and also the supporters or crest which Nell
assumed, namely, the lion and leopard.&nbsp; The whole is
curiously worked in various coloured glass beads, and the figures
with the dresses are made to project in very high relief; indeed,
they are merely attached to the ground-work.&nbsp; In the upper
compartment is Charles in his state dress, and in the bottom one
that of Nell Gwynne in her court dress&mdash;the pattern of which
is very tasteful.&nbsp; On the right is Charles in his hunting
dress, and on the left is Nell in her neglig&eacute;e
dress.&nbsp; The beads have retained their colours, which are
very appropriate to the subject, and must have been a work of
considerable time and patience; but whether done by Nell or not,
there is no record.&nbsp; Mrs. Jameson
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Charles, in spite of every attempt to detach
him from her, loved her to the last, and his last thought was for
her&mdash;&lsquo;Let not poor Nelly starve!&rsquo;&nbsp; Burnet,
who records this dying speech, is piously scandalized that the
King should have thought of such a &lsquo;creature&rsquo; in such
a moment; but some will consider it with more mercy, as one among
the few traits which redeem the sensual and worthless Charles
from utter contempt.&rdquo;</p>

PERSECUTIONS FOR CONSCIENCE&rsquo; SAKE.</h2>
<p>During the persecutions for conscience&rsquo; sake, several
inhabitants of Brighton underwent sundry pains and
penalties.&nbsp; In 1658, John Pullot, <a
name="citation134"></a><a href="#footnote134"
class="citation">[134]</a> for speaking to the Priest and people
in the Steeple-house, was put prisoner into the
Block-house;&mdash;Churches or houses having a steeple and a
bell, were termed Steeple-houses.&nbsp; The next day Pullot was
sent to the County gaol till the Sessions, when he was sentenced
to Bridewell for six months&rsquo; hard labour, and to be
whipped.&nbsp; In 1659, Nicholas Beard, for going into the
Steeple-house, was much abused, and hauled out by the hair of his
head.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Abstract&rdquo; referred to
recites:&mdash;&ldquo;1658.&mdash;A meeting being held at the
house of William Gold, in Brighthelmston; the professors of that
town, coming from their worship, first broke the windows, which
work one zealous woman was observed to do very devoutly with her
bible; then they flung in much filth on those that were there
met, and at length thrusting in upon them, hauled out Joseph Fuce
and some others, throwing him very dangerously on the ground, and
hauling him and others out of the town, threatened that if he
came thither again they would throw him into the sea.&nbsp; After
this manner did the people there frequently abuse those who were
assembled together; of which abuses Margery Caustock had a large
share.&nbsp; Her daughter also, of the same name, going from a
meeting was cruelly stoned and wounded in the face, to the
endangering her eye; and her blood was spilt to that degree that
some of her wicked persecutors boasted that they had killed one
Quaker, as they had almost done another, namely, Richard Pratt,
by stoning him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pratt had previously, in 1656, delivered in a paper to the
Bench of Justices, at the Lewes Sessions, representing the cruel
usage and stoning of his friends at Brighthelmston, and desiring
them to exert their authority for protecting the innocent from
such <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>abuses; when he was by them committed to the House of
Correction, and ordered to be whipped there, and kept to hard
labour.&nbsp; As the officers were dragging him away to
Bridewell, one William Hobbine, seeing him in danger from the
pushing of the people, laid hold of him to keep him from
falling.&nbsp; This being interpreted an attempt to rescue the
prisoner, Hobbine was fined three pounds, and sent to prison for
not paying it.</p>
<p>Thus the persecutions of the Quakers continued in all parts of
the kingdom, till General Monk having had complaint made to him
of the rude disturbances of Meetings by his soldiers, while at
Westminster, he, with complete success, issued the following
order:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">St. James&rsquo;s, March
9, 1659&ndash;60.</p>
<p>I do require all officers and soldiers, to forbear to disturb
the peaceable meetings of the Quakers, they doing nothing
prejudicial to the Parliament of England.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Monk</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In consequence of Monk having declared for the Commonwealth,
Charles II., who for some years had resided on the continent,
after his escape from Brighton, by his advice repaired to
Breda.&nbsp; But it being resolved in England to recall him to
the throne, he made, on the 14th day of April, 1660, his
celebrated Declaration of Breda, whereby he granted a free and
general pardon to all offenders against himself and his royal
father, and &ldquo;liberty of conscience, that no man shall be
disquieted or called in question for differences of opinion, in
matter of religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Restoration was the result
on the 18th of May following, and on the 29th of the same month,
his birthday, he made his public entry into London.</p>
<p>The Act of Uniformity, which was passed in 1662, and was
called the St. Bartholomew Act, because it was to take effect on
the 24th of August, the feast of that apostle, produced a kind of
ecclesiastical revolution, and shewed the invincible
determination of the enthusiasts.&nbsp; The date of the
Bi-centenary of this Act, is the 24th of August of the present
year, 1862.&nbsp; The Act was short, but very stringent, as the
annexed extract XIV. Caroli II., 1662.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Be it enacted by the King&rsquo;s most excellent
Majesty, by the advice and with the consent of the Lords
spiritual and temporal, and of the Commons in this present
Parliament, that every Parson, Vicar, or other Minister, who now
hath any Ecclesiastical Benefice or Preferment within the Realm
of England, shall, in <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the Church, Chapel, or place of
public worship, upon some Lord&rsquo;s Day, before the Feast of
St. Bartholomew, which shall be in the year of our Lord God,
1662, publicly and solemnly read the morning and evening prayers,
according to the said Book of Common Prayer, at the times
appointed, and after such reading thereof, shall openly and
publicly, before the congregation, declare his unfeigned assent
and consent to the use of all things in the said book in these
words and no others&mdash;I, A. B., declare my unfeigned assent
and consent to all and everything contained and prescribed in and
by the Book of Common Prayer.&nbsp; And that every such person
who shall (without some lawful impediment) neglect or refuse to
do the same, shall be deprived of all his spiritual promotion;
and the Patron shall present or collate, as if he were dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one day, and by a concerted resolution, 2,000 presbyterian
ministers resigned their livings, because they would not conform
to the articles of the Act.&nbsp; They were even, some time
after, prohibited from coming within five miles of those places
where they had exercised their ministry, except on journeys,
under pain of six months&rsquo; imprisonment, and paying a
penalty of five pounds.&nbsp; These rigorous proceedings were by
no means agreeable to the king, who was solicited by his brother
James, to grant a general toleration.&nbsp; Charles, in
consequence, proclaimed an indulgence to those whose consciences
would not permit them to conform to the established worship; and
as Parliament was then prorogued, he gave his royal word, that at
the approaching session, he would endeavour to procure a
confirmation of that indulgence.&nbsp; On the 18th of February,
1663, therefore, on the assembling of Parliament, Charles
endeavoured to fulfil his promise; but the Parliament strongly
suspected that he had another and much deeper design in view, his
avowed intention being to gratify the Dissenters, but his secret
resolution being to support the Catholics, so they determined to
defeat him.&nbsp; He in consequence, from a remonstrance which
they drew up, issued a proclamation against all Popish Priests
and Jesuits.</p>
<p>In 1664, the Parliament, not content with the penalties
contained in the Act of Uniformity, passed the notorious
Conventicle Act, whereby it was enacted that if any one should
repair to Conventicles,&mdash;the name they gave to the
meeting-houses of all Dissenters,&mdash;he should be fined
&pound;5 for the first offence, or suffer three months&rsquo;
imprisonment; for the second offence &pound;10, or six
months&rsquo; imprisonment; but for the third offence, after
being convicted <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>by a jury of his peers or fellows, he was to be
transported to some foreign plantation, or pay the penalty of
&pound;100.</p>
<p>In 1665, upon the assembling of the Parliament at Oxford, a
Bill was brought before that august body, that no dissenting
teacher, who refused to take the oath of non-resistance, should,
except upon the road, come within five miles of any corporation,
or of any place where he had discharged the offices of a
minister, after the Act of Oblivion, as it was called, under the
penalty of &pound;50.&nbsp; The Commons rejected the Bill, which
imposed the oath of non-resistance on the whole nation. <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; The Conventicle Act was passed
in 1670.&nbsp; By it every member of a Conventicle, or assembly
of Non-Conformists, consisting of more than five persons,
exclusive of the family where it was held, was liable to a
fine.</p>
<p>One of the most virulent officials in persecuting the
Non-Conformists, was Captain Tettersell, who effected the escape
of the King.&nbsp; On Sunday, the 29th of May, 1670, while
exercising his authority as High Constable of Brighton, he, with
the zeal of a bigot, and the malign industry of a ministerial
spy, discovered in the town a house in which a few Dissenters had
privately met: and the door having been barred against so
unfriendly an intruder, he surrounded the premises with his
creatures, until a warrant for breaking the door open arrived
from Sir Thomas Nutt, of Lewes.&nbsp; When the warrant arrived,
the door was opened upon the demand of the Constable; but no
minister could be found; nor were the company engaged in any
religious ceremony.&nbsp; It was, however, asserted by some of
the Constable&rsquo;s assistants, that they had heard from within
a voice in the elevated tone of prayer or instruction, and for
this imputed offence, the whole party was summoned before the
said Sir Thomas Nutt, and other Justices at Lewes.&nbsp; But
there being no proof to justify conviction under the Conventicle
Act, the bench insidiously counselled the objects of their
persecution to confess the whole, and promised they would permit
them to set their own fines.&nbsp; Finding them averse to
self-accusation, where they were conscious of no crime, these
upright dispensers of justice, even on the vague conjecture of
the spies, fined to the full penalty of the Statute, not <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>only such
as were found in the house, but also a man who had been seen
coming out some time before the said spies approached it.&nbsp;
William Beard, the master of the house, having been fined
&pound;20, Captain Tettersell broke open his malthouse, and took
thereout sixty-five bushel sacks of malt, which he sold to one of
his partisans for twelve shillings a quarter. <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a>&nbsp; Sir Thomas Nutt was a most
malign retailer of penal law, and he prevailed on three other
justices to co-operate with him in order to sanction the rancour
of persecution.&nbsp; Other Constables besides Tettersell, also,
were the too willing harpies of oppression under the mask of
law.</p>

THE BIRDS AND THEIR HAUNTS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BRIGHTON.</h2>
<p>The Sussex coast is a favourite locality for the greater
portion of our British Birds, more particularly the migratory
species.&nbsp; The high headlands to the eastward seem to be a
great attraction to them by day, and, as a great many take
nocturnal flight, the glare of light at night sent high into the
vault of the heavens from the gas lamps in the town of Brighton,
attracts a great number to this neighbourhood, and many rare
specimens have been obtained.&nbsp; The migration of birds is a
subject of considerable interest in their natural history to the
Ornithologist.&nbsp; It was formerly supposed that many birds,
which now are known for a certainty to migrate, retired to some
secure retreat, and remained dormant through the winter.&nbsp; So
general was this impression that in some districts of England
seven of the migratory birds obtained the names of the seven
sleepers.&nbsp; The Cuckoo was one of these; and the Swallows
were supposed to lie up in a torpid state during the
winter.&nbsp; Most birds migrate, and those which cross the seas
are called &ldquo;Birds of Passage.&rdquo;&nbsp; A great number
of our birds remove as the cold weather sets in, from the inland
districts towards the sea shores, which afford them a better
supply of food.</p>
<p>In the Spring of the year&mdash;March and April&mdash;we have
the greatest arrival of our summer visitors, and it is
astonishing with what order and punctuality they arrive and
depart.&nbsp; They are the unerring messengers of Spring; and,
true to Nature&rsquo;s laws, arrive generally within a few days
of the time pointed out by the scientific observations of the
Ornithologist.</p>
<p>The poets, from Chaucer downwards, have largely introduced
birds into their works.&nbsp; Chaucer, in his &ldquo;Assembly of
Fowles,&rdquo; says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>On every bough the birdis herd I syng.<br />
With voice of Angell in their harmonie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Milton, in praising the nightingale, says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
the wakeful bird<br />
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid,<br />
Tunes her nocturnal note.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Erskine, in beautiful words, says&mdash;All our poets,
from the greatest to the least, from the first to the last,
acknowledge by their writings how much they owe to the
productions of Nature, both animate and inanimate.</p>
<p>The Golden Eagle&mdash;<i>Falco chrysaetos</i>&mdash;is
mentioned by Yarrell, in his &ldquo;History of British
Birds,&rdquo; as having been shot near Bexhill, but none of our
late writers on Ornithology have been able to authenticate the
fact.&nbsp; We have not been honoured with a visit from his
imperial majesty the king of birds.&nbsp; Several specimens of
the White-tailed Eagle&mdash;<i>Falco albicilla</i>,&mdash;have
been shot in the immediate neighbourhood, and the parties have
always fancied they have been lucky enough to obtain the true
Golden Eagle.&nbsp; A gentleman from Brighton, being at Shoreham
some years ago, just after the landlord of the Dolphin Inn had
shot what he considered was the Golden Eagle, somewhat surprised
the imagined lucky shot by assuring him that it showed too much
of its legs, and that it was only an immature specimen of the Sea
Eagle; and so it turned out.&nbsp; Several others are likewise
recorded as having been shot in this neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Osprey, or Fishing Hawk&mdash;<i>Falco
hali&aelig;tus</i>,&mdash;has of late years been a rare visitant
in this vicinity, though several are authenticated as having been
shot here formerly.&nbsp; They are occasional visitors along our
shores, but seldom go far inland for their prey, as they are true
fishermen, living entirely upon the fruits of their labour; and
they are very formidable, and powerfully winged birds, darting
down from a great height, like an arrow from a bow, upon their
prey with unerring certainty.&nbsp; In North <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>America
they are welcomed in the Spring by the fishermen, as the happy
omen of the approach of herring, shad, &amp;c., which
periodically arrive there on the coast, in prodigious shoals.</p>
<p>Eastward of Brighton, about fourteen miles, is Beachy Head,
the home, from time immemorial, of a pair of Peregrine
Falcons&mdash;<i>Falco peregrinus</i>; another pair is generally
to be found in the high cliffs near Seaford.&nbsp; This noble
bird was the pride of our ancestors in their sporting diversions,
and was considered very valuable when possessed of the particular
qualities most in request.&nbsp; Yarrell, in his &ldquo;History
of British Birds,&rdquo; mentions that in the reign of James I.
Sir Thomas Monson is said to have given one thousand pounds for a
cast (a couple) of these hawks.&nbsp; The high perpendicular
cliffs at Beachy Head have always been a favourite breeding place
for the Peregrines, and where their young are generally every
year taken by a man whose companions let him over the cliff by
means of a derrick.&nbsp; The derrick is simply a pole with a
sheave-wheel at one end of it, for the rope to pass over, and is
run about two feet over the edge of the cliff, and at the other
end it has a hole, through which an iron bar is passed and driven
firmly into the ground to keep it steady.&nbsp; By this
contrivance the man is lowered to the required spot, and hauled
up again in safety, and though the process has been going on for
many years, no instance is recorded of any accident having
occurred.&nbsp; By this means also a great many of the eggs of
the Willock&mdash;<i>Uria troili</i>&mdash;and Razor
bill&mdash;<i>Alca torda</i>,&mdash;are taken; these birds breed
here in great numbers every year.&nbsp; The derrick is a familiar
machine to the smuggler, as it enables him to get his tubs very
expeditiously from the bottom to the top of the cliff, which is
done by several men on the beach taking hold of the end of the
rope, and running straight out with it, and then fastening on the
tubs in clusters.&nbsp; Sometimes they are brought up in this way
four or five hundred feet.&nbsp; These cliffs are likewise the
resort and breeding places of a great many
Jackdaws&mdash;<i>Corvus monedula</i>.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago the Red Legged Crow, or Cornish
Chough&mdash;<i>Pyrrhocorax graculus</i>&mdash;was common here,
though now the species is nearly or quite extinct all along our
southern shores.&nbsp; A man, now between sixty and seventy years
of age, who has been in the constant habit of going nearly all
his life, to Beachy Head to catch prawns <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>for a
livelihood, says that he remembers the Red-billed Daw perfectly
well, and that the last he saw there, was fifty-three or
fifty-four years ago, and that he recollects to this day the
precise spot where he saw them.&nbsp; There were seven in
company, and he describes their flight to be a succession of
jerks, or in the manner of a Dishwasher, which is very
peculiar.&nbsp; It was ninety years ago that Gilbert White, of
Selborne, recorded the fact of their abounding at Beachy Head and
all along the cliffs of the Sussex Coast.</p>
<p>A little to the westward of the highest part of the cliffs,
upon a projecting portion, called Beltout, stands Beachy Head
lighthouse, a very handsome and solid structure, built entirely
of granite.&nbsp; It is supposed that it will last till the solid
chalk cliff washes away from under it.&nbsp; It stands about
thirty yards from the edge of the perpendicular cliff, which is
here about one hundred and forty yards high, with the sea at
highwater washing its base.&nbsp; It has a revolving light of
three sides, with ten argand lamps in each with highly polished
reflectors, kept in motion by machinery wound up like a clock,
two or three times in a night.&nbsp; It is managed by two
light-keepers, whose duty is to keep the lamps burning and
revolving from sunset to sunrise, all the year round.&nbsp; It
has no doubt been the means of saving numerous vessels from being
lost upon that once very dangerous part of the Sussex coast.</p>
<p>At the foot of the cliff, nearly under the Lighthouse, is a
cave called &ldquo;Darby&rsquo;s Hole,&rdquo; said to have been
cut out more than a hundred years ago, by a clergyman of that
name living at East Dean, a little village about a
mile-and-a-half off, for the philanthropic purpose of saving the
lives of shipwrecked sailors; and it is handed down as a fact
that he had the pleasure at one time of saving nearly a dozen
poor men from a watery grave.&nbsp; Formerly, hardly a winter
passed without three or four wrecks occurring, which proved a
great assistance to the poor villagers of East Dean.&nbsp; A
laughable story is told of a wreck happening a great many years
ago, on a Sunday morning whilst most of the villagers were in
church, when a man wishing to inform some of his friends there of
the circumstance, quietly slipped in for that purpose, and it was
soon whispered from one to another that there was &ldquo;a
wreck,&rdquo; and they so kept going out one after the other that
the church got <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>considerably thinned.&nbsp; The clergyman seeing that
he was likely to be left nearly alone, and suspecting the cause,
he in a loud audible voice said, &ldquo;If there is a wreck, say
so, and let&rsquo;s all start fair.&rdquo;&mdash;The story goes
that the news of the wreck was rather a hoax than otherwise, as
the fact of &ldquo;a four-mast vessel laden with wool and tallow
ashore,&rdquo; proved to be nothing other than the carcase of a
South-down sheep washed up by the tide.</p>
<p>The lighthouse has a very pleasing effect when viewed by night
from the sea, and on a fine summer&rsquo;s evening, parties
frequently make excursions from Eastbourne and other places to
visit it.&nbsp; Being situate on the South Downs the walk to it
is most delightful, the turf being so very fine, that it may be
compared to a Turkey carpet, and in July and August the air is
highly fragrant with wild aromatic herbs, thyme, &amp;c.&nbsp; At
the same time of the year great quantities of those delicious
birds, Wheatears&mdash;<i>Sylvia &oelig;nanthe</i>,&mdash;arrive,
and are scattered over the extensive Downs in vast numbers, but
not in flocks, as they are almost invariably seen singly.&nbsp;
It is a great perquisite to the shepherds to catch them, which
they do by cutting out lines of traps in the turf in the form of
a T, and inverting the turf over a couple of horse-hair
nooses.&nbsp; Pennant states, that in his time the numbers snared
about Eastbourne amounted annually to about one thousand eight
hundred and forty dozen.&nbsp; They are called the English
Ortolan, from their being so fat and plump and of such a
delicious flavour.&nbsp; They are a great delicacy potted.&nbsp;
They are, however, gradually lessening in numbers, year after
year, so that it hardly pays the shepherds now, for their time
and trouble to get their traps ready.</p>
<p>Along the whole range of the South Downs the Wheatear has its
haunts, especially about the vicinity of the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke,
which is a place of general rendezvous for sportsmen and
pleasure-seekers.&nbsp; It was formerly known as the Poor
Man&rsquo;s Wall, and even now, in its deep trenches, exhibits
the form and extent of a Roman encampment.</p>
<p>About five-and-forty years ago, in consequence of the large
extent of company that frequented the spot in summer-time, to
view the vast expanse of country which the site commands, Mr.
Sharp, a confectioner, then carrying on his business in North
Street, on the <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>spot now occupied by the premises of Mr. Abrahams,
outfitter, conceived the idea of establishing a place for
refreshment near the summit of the hill, and for that purpose
hired a piece of ground north of the high vallum which runs
westward from the top of the Dyke to the brow of the hill.&nbsp;
Thither he conveyed a wooden house that had been used as a bacon
shop by a man named Smith.&nbsp; It formerly stood upon wooden
wheels opposite the shop of Mr. Hyam Lewis, silversmith, in Ship
Street Lane, now the upper end of Ship Street; but it at present
forms a dwelling place, under the hill, by the turnpike road to
Fulking, at the base of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl, close by
the village of Poynings.</p>
<p>The person who first superintended the Dyke establishment was
Mr. Russell, who was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Sturt.&nbsp; His
successor was Mr. Thomas King, familiarly then and now known as
&ldquo;Tommy King,&rdquo; whose refreshing beverages and
exhilirating fiddling gave him a far and near notoriety.&nbsp;
The premises were only occupied and opened during the Summer
season, from May to October; and although stabling and other
accommodation were constructed, in a few years the public
requirements induced the erection of the present building, the
Dyke House, by Mr. Hardwick, and it has successively passed from
King to Mr. Edwards, of Horsham, the tenant who obtained the
spirit license; Mr. Ade, of Huntingdon; Mr. William Cooper, of
Brighton; Mr. Peter Barkshire, now of Patcham; to its present
occupier, Mr. William Thacker, who has been landlord of the
house, and tenant of the farm attached twenty-seven years, during
which period he has received the royal patronage of William IV.
and Her present Majesty and the late Prince Consort.&nbsp; The
house has also been the resort of many illustrious foreign
visitors, amongst whom may be named Prince Metternich and Count
Nesselrode.</p>
<p>The most notorious character who took up his abode here, was
Azimullah Khan, the great promoter of the Mutiny in India.&nbsp;
He was a resident in Brighton during the Spring and Summer of
1846; but towards the latter end of the Autumn of that year, by
the alleged advice of his physician, he, for three weeks, had
apartments at the Dyke House; and during that time he was
constantly receiving and sending off Indian overland messengers
with enormous <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>despatches, without doubt having reference to that
shocking revolt which will for ever remain an odious blot upon
the history of our East Indian dominions.&nbsp; Azimullah was the
Prime Minister of the arch fiend, Nana Sahib; and though it might
be saying too much in declaring that the plan of the insurrection
was decided upon at the Dyke House, there is little doubt that
the first copy of the proclamation was prepared there.&nbsp;
Lieutenant Delafosse, one of the few survivors of the Cawnpore
massacre, on his return to England visited the Dyke, and there
assured Mr Thacker that he saw Azimullah on the river bank at
Cawnpore, in the company of Nana Sahib, waving his sword when the
guns were discharging their murderous balls into the boats which
contained the defenceless victims.</p>
<p>The steep sides of the Dyke have been the scenes of numerous
accidents, from persons having the temerity to run down
them.&nbsp; Some daring feats of riding and driving have also
been exhibited here.&nbsp; The most memorable and daring act was
that of Tom Poole, who, for the wager of a champagne dinner for
twelve, drove a tandem down the most abrupt part.&nbsp; It was
most cleverly accomplished, without the least accident; but that
he might not be disappointed in participating in the wagered
repast,&mdash;in the event of the loss of life or limb in the
performance of the exploit,&mdash;he insisted upon having the
dinner before he undertook his task.&nbsp; Many other dare-devil
tricks have been attempted here; and perhaps the most remarkable
is that related in what is familiarly known as the</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">LEGEND OF THE
DEVIL&rsquo;S DYKE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, at the period of yore, in the days of
mistletoe and harvest-homing, when our country merited the title
of &lsquo;merrie England,&rsquo; there was to be found on the
edge of the South Downs, opposite the pleasant little village of
Poynings, in Sussex, a humble hostel, or village Inn, yclept
&lsquo;The Jolly Shepherd,&rsquo; kept by one Dame Margery, who,
in her younger days, had followed the camp, but had long since
retired upon her reputation as a trooper&rsquo;s widow.&nbsp; The
accommodations of the &lsquo;Jolly Shepherd&rsquo; would be held
in slight repute in modern days, but in the time of which we are
speaking they were reckoned all-sufficient, although <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>consisting
chiefly of a warm seat by a cheerful fire, fresh eggs and bacon,
and good honest home-brewed ale; and accordingly some half-dozen
rustic customers were seated round the widow&rsquo;s hearth, to
escape the cutting blast of the Downs without, and commemorate
the eve of Holy Saint John, within.&nbsp; Suddenly the song and
the tale of the party were interrupted by a most mysterious
knocking at the door, and a shrill, querulous voice demanding
instant admittance.&nbsp; The active old hostess hastened to
obey, but made a kind of a jump, step, and hop backward, on
beholding the unusual appearance of the new arrival, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Lord preserve us! what is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A
gentleman from below,&rsquo; replied a little, decrepid, wizened
old man,</p>
<p>Whose coat was red, whose breeches were blue,<br />
With a little hole where a tail came through.</p>
<p>He glided into the room and crept along by the wall, with the
most infernal ceremony and politeness, to the inner recess of the
chimney corner, without having once shown his back to his hostess
or any of the good company there assembled, and quickly finding
himself comfortably seated, the queer little old gentleman
produced a blackened &lsquo;Dudeen&rsquo; and a velvet tobacco
pouch, but somehow or other the clouds of smoke he emitted were
so pervaded with the smell of brimstone and bitumen, that the
rest of the guests did nothing but sneeze and knock their heads
together in a regular hob-and-nob fashion.&nbsp; To stop this
nuisance, the worthy hostess placed before her mysterious guest a
frizzing hot dish of eggs and bacon, but upon tasting the same,
he expressed his dissatisfaction, declaring it was as cold as
charity, and demanding &lsquo;more pepper.&rsquo;&nbsp; He, upon
receiving it, emptied the contents of the pepper-box over the
dish, and having thus formed a regular <i>pate au diable</i>, he
swallowed it down with considerable apparent relish.&nbsp; With
the ale it was pretty much the same; the hostess first mulled it,
but her refractory guest declared it was as cold as ice; then she
boiled it with a vast quantity of ginger, but with little better
success, and it could only be brought to suit his fiery palate by
being stirred up, when boiling, with a red hot poker.&nbsp; These
strange proceedings of the mysterious visitor mightily astonished
the rest of the guests, their faces becoming much elongated; and
after staring at <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>each other in stupified bewilderment, they stealthily
took to their homes, exclaiming, &lsquo;Did you ever see the
Devil?&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole of the company had departed long
ere the cause of their uneasiness left his chimney corner and
glided to his sleeping apartment, which he managed to do in the
same mysterious manner as he had entered the house, never once
removing his back from the wall.&nbsp; About three o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, our worthy hostess of &lsquo;The Jolly
Shepherd&rsquo; was awakened from her balmy slumbers, by a
strange thumping, bumping kind of noise just under her window,
seeming to resemble the hubbub made by a shoal of whales or other
such lumbering monsters, who had quitted the ocean deep, and
taken to wallowing and gambolling along the Downs by way of
pastime.&nbsp; The trooper&rsquo;s widow possessed a bold heart,
and, added thereto, she had a woman&rsquo;s curiosity, which
induced her to creep out of bed, and cautiously to take a peep at
what was going on.&nbsp; She was amazed?&nbsp; She did not behold
half a dozen Leviathans having a game at leap-frog, nor the like
number of griffins playing at snap-dragon.&nbsp; No, no, nothing
of that sort; but the queer little old gentleman aforesaid,
mounted on a pair of lofty stilts, with a huge spade in his hand,
was digging away at the edge of the ancient Roman encampment,
like the very &lsquo;old-un,&rsquo; shovelling out the chalk and
flint stones by waggon loads, and his tail whisking about like a
serpent in fits.&nbsp; The bold hostess did not hail him to stop
his digging.&nbsp; Not she, good honest soul, as she was desirous
of seeing a little clearer what he was about, before giving any
alarm; so she quickly struck a light, and lest the candle should
alarm her ancient guest, she caught up something to put before
it, and this something fortunately happened to be a sieve.&nbsp;
Suddenly the old gentleman ceased working, looked up at the
window, and when he saw the candle behind the seive, surmounted
by the old woman&rsquo;s night cap, he exclaimed &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp;
Beelzebub, the rising sun,&rsquo; and folding his stilts across
to form a spindle, he ducked his head forward and rolling himself
into a ball like a hedgehog, he went bounding along the Downs
with fearful rapidity.&nbsp; The Right Rev. Rector of Poynings
had been to a jolly christening, had made a wet night of it, and
was endeavouring to navigate his road homewards, when he saw a
sort of galvanized <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>harlequin whirling and tumbling along straight towards
him.&nbsp; The Rev. Rector stopped short; when, just on passing,
a sharp pointed sting was protruded from the rolling mass; and
having slightly touched his Reverence&rsquo;s great toe, the
whole ball exhaled, evaporated and vanished&mdash;<i>exit in
fumo</i>.&nbsp; The parish duties of Poynings were performed by
the Curate for the next three months; the doctor said his
Reverence was laid up with the gout, but the Rector himself
maintained it was the Devil.&nbsp; The question has ever since
been, what could induce this queer old gentleman to set to work
and dig away in such an outlandish fashion?&nbsp; Some old
gossips say that his evil intention was to let in the salt sea,
and flood all this most beautiful valley of pleasant
Sussex.&nbsp; Be that as it may, one fact is worth noting, that
the hostelry of &lsquo;The Jolly Shepherd,&rsquo; from that
period ceased its existence, and never, in the village of
Poynings, since that night, when his Satanic Majesty was foiled,
has a license been held by any person <i>again</i> to &lsquo;sell
spirits.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The largest attendance of visitors to the Dyke, is during the
months of August and September, when, frequently, as many as a
hundred carriages a-day arrive with parties, either to view the
magnificent expanse of scenery which the spot commands, or on
pic-nic excursions, as the establishment has accommodation for
many sets of visitors at the same time.&nbsp; The predilection
which the English have for displaying their wit in snatches of
their poetic genius, has, on the walls of the rooms, the
looking-glasses, and the panes of glass in the windows, extensive
scope, and signatures innumerable crowd every available spot.</p>

To names ignoble, born to be forgot,<br />

<p>The house being erected in so exposed and elevated a
situation, one of the highest of the South-Down range, damage by
gales and storms is very frequent.&nbsp; From the loneliness of
its position, too, burglars have made various attempts to obtain
spoil, but the reception they have always met with has rendered
their expeditions a trouble rather than a profit.&nbsp; The spot
was especially chosen by the late Duke of St. Albans for his
hawking excursions, as it afforded an extensive range of sight to
the numerous company of nobility and <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>gentry, who attended upon such
occasions to witness that old English pastime.&nbsp; The Brighton
Harriers, at least once a week during the season, throw off here,
and other packs make it their place of meeting.</p>
<p>But to return to the more immediate subject of this Chapter,
the feathered tribe, from which there has been a slight
digression, for the record of facts that form an important link
in the chain of local history:</p>
<p>The Buzzard&mdash;<i>Falco buteo</i>,&mdash;is another of our
indigenous birds, which has nearly disappeared from this
district, and what was many years ago called the Common Buzzard
is now very rare.&nbsp; They were formerly frequently met with
among the furze near the edge of the cliffs, where they were
constantly at war with the Jackdaws.</p>
<p>The Black Redstart&mdash;<i>Sylvia tithys</i>,&mdash;is
considered rare in this country; but Brighton has been fortunate
in affording several examples of this handsome and graceful bird,
which is a winter visitor.</p>
<p>The Common Redstart&mdash;<i>Sylvia
ph&oelig;nicurus</i>,&mdash;unlike his <i>confrere</i>, is a
summer visitor, generally arriving about the second week in
April.&nbsp; Their migration seems to be gregarious, as they are
to be met with in flocks of ten or a dozen, close by the sea
shore, a little to the westward of Brighton, where they have
apparently just arrived.&nbsp; In a day or two, they distribute
themselves over the country, and are hardly ever seen again, but
singly, or at most in pairs.&nbsp; This bird has several dark red
feathers on the rump, and the country people call it the Fire
Tail.</p>
<p>The Grasshopper Warbler&mdash;<i>Sylvia
locustella</i>,&mdash;is a very shy bird, and consequently is
very rarely seen.&nbsp; It is a great ventriloquist, and its note
is exactly like the grasshopper, (hence its name), only very much
louder, and so very peculiar, that a person may be within a yard
or two of the bird, and yet be unable to define the exact
spot.&nbsp; It is not a scarce bird, and several nests of it have
been found at the Holm-bush, and almost any fine evening in June
it may be heard there.&nbsp; Its haunts are at the edges of large
woods, in low scrubby bushes.</p>
<p>The Sedge Warbler&mdash;<i>Sylvia phragmitis</i>,&mdash;may be
found in the <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Summer months in the marshes that run up from Shoreham
to Beeding.&nbsp; It is one of our night singing birds.</p>
<p>The Reed Wren or Reed Warbler&mdash;<i>Sylvia
arundinacea</i>,&mdash;is found in precisely the same locality as
the last, and where, during the Summer months, several of their
extraordinary nests have been found.&nbsp; They generally prefer
the ditches where the reeds grow the thickest.&nbsp; In making
their nest, which is very deep, they bring three or four stout
reeds together with their materials, near the water, and it is so
beautifully and scientifically constructed, that in case of
floods, the nest will rise up the stems.&nbsp; Any lover of
Natural History, if he is not aware of the fact, or seen their
nests, would be delighted with the beautiful provision which
Nature here carries out.</p>
<p>The Nightingale&mdash;<i>Sylvia luscinia</i>,&mdash;is the
most musical, most melancholy of birds, the poet&rsquo;s
bird,&mdash;<i>par excellence</i>.&nbsp; On Poynings Common,
through May, they may be heard in the greatest perfection, where
they tune their melodious nocturnal love song through the
livelong night.&nbsp; They generally arrive about the second week
in April.</p>
<p>The Dartford Warbler&mdash;<i>Sylvia
provincialis</i>,&mdash;is said by most writers on British birds,
to be extremely rare, but on the Downs, two or three miles to the
north-east of Newhaven, they have been seen among the
furze.&nbsp; They have a propensity for keeping near the ground
in the high furze, and a great dislike to exhibit
themselves.&nbsp; They are local, and tolerably abundant in their
<i>habitat</i>.</p>
<p>There are five species of Wagtail that are visitors in the
neighbourhood of Brighton.&nbsp; The White
Wagtail&mdash;<i>Motacilla alba</i>,&mdash;so nearly resembles
the common Pied Wagtail&mdash;<i>Motacilla
yarrellii</i>,&mdash;that to a common observer there appears
scarcely any difference.&nbsp; The Gray
Wagtail&mdash;<i>Motacilla boarula</i>,&mdash;and the Grayheaded
Wagtail&mdash;<i>Motacilla flava</i>,&mdash;are rare birds to
this country; but both have been shot in this locality.&nbsp; The
Yellow or Rays Wagtail&mdash;<i>Motacilla
campestris</i>,&mdash;is common in the Spring of the year, and
may be found by the edges of running streams.&nbsp; To the
eastward of Brighton the whole family of the Wagtails are called
Dishwashers.</p>
<p>Sky Larks&mdash;<i>Alauda arvensis</i>,&mdash;in October, come
in large flights <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>from the east.&nbsp; It is a favourite amusement with
the Cockney sportsmen of Brighton, on a nice sunshiny morning, to
go just outside the town, with what is called a lark glass, which
is simply a piece of wood about a foot long, planed like the
ridge of a house, having small pieces of looking glass let in the
sides, and a wooden pin fitted in a socket or stump which is
firmly driven in the ground, and is set spinning backwards and
forwards by a string.&nbsp; By this means the poor birds are
decoyed down; and they seem fascinated by the glitter of the
glass, as they keep hovering within a few feet of it, and are not
easily driven away; consequently they present easy marks for the
shooter.&nbsp; A dozen or more will hover over the glass at one
time, and a tolerable marksman will sometimes kill three or four
dozen of a morning.&nbsp; The sport is generally over by
half-past nine or ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; In the
winter,&mdash;generally at the first fall of snow,&mdash;immense
flights of larks come coasting along, driven apparently from the
cold northern climes, towards the more genial west.&nbsp; The
numbers that pass over Brighton are incredible, they sometimes
extend to millions a-day, as from early light to dusk there is a
continued stream, at least a quarter of a mile wide, passing
along.&nbsp; On the road to Rottingdean is where the greatest
flights may be observed.&nbsp; They are apparently continental
visitors, coming across the German Ocean in a north-east
direction.&nbsp; The flight seldom lasts more than two or three
days.</p>
<p>The Ortolan Bunting&mdash;<i>Emberiza hortulana</i>,&mdash;has
twice been obtained in and near Brighton; but it is a very rare
bird in this country.</p>
<p>The Hoopoe&mdash;<i>Upupa epops</i>,&mdash;the most beautiful
of all our British birds, is a frequent visitor in the Spring of
the year to this part of the country.&nbsp; In May, 1845, Mr
Swaysland, Naturalist, Queen&rsquo;s Road, had to preserve and
mount six Hoopoes, which were killed within a few miles of
Brighton.</p>
<p>The Great Norfolk Plover, or Stone
Curlew&mdash;<i>&OElig;dicnemus crepitans</i>,&mdash;is becoming
very scarce now, though formerly these birds were tolerably
abundant.&nbsp; Their haunts were generally to be found among the
large open stony fallows of our downs.&nbsp; They are like all
the family of Charadriid&aelig;, very shy birds.</p>
<p>The Golden Plover&mdash;<i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>,&mdash;the
Ringed Dotterell&mdash;<a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span><i>Charadrius
morinellus</i>,&mdash;the Grey Plover&mdash;<i>Vanellus
melanogaster</i>,&mdash;the Turnstone&mdash;<i>Strepsilas
interpres</i>,&mdash;the Sanderling&mdash;<i>Calidris
arenaria</i>,&mdash;the Oystercatcher&mdash;<i>H&aelig;matopus
ostralegus</i>,&mdash;are all, every year, to be met with in the
little bays and inlets, on the beach between Brighton and
Shoreham Harbour; as are also the Curlew&mdash;<i>Numenius
arquata</i>,&mdash;the Whimbrel&mdash;<i>Numenius
ph&aelig;opus</i>,&mdash;the Red-hawk&mdash;<i>Totanus
calidris</i>,&mdash;the Sandpiper&mdash;<i>Totanus
hypoleucos</i>,&mdash;the Greenhawk&mdash;<i>Totanus
glottis</i>,&mdash;the Blackheaded Godwit&mdash;<i>Limosa
melanura</i>.&nbsp; The Ruff&mdash;<i>Machetes
pugnax</i>,&mdash;is also found in the above locality, as well as
several other species of the Waders.&nbsp; The Curlew
Sandpiper&mdash;<i>Tringa subarquata</i>,&mdash;and the Little
Stint&mdash;<i>Tringa minuta</i>,&mdash;have both been killed in
the same place, though their visits are rare and far between.</p>
<p>The Gray Phalarope&mdash;<i>Phalaropus
platyrhynchus</i>,&mdash;has occasionally been met with,
generally in flocks of from ten to fifteen, and upwards.&nbsp;
They are nearly or quite the smallest web-footed birds that are
known; their homes are in the cold northern climes, and they are
so unacquainted with man and his terrible engines of destruction,
that they are apparently tame.&nbsp; Two gentlemen once fell in
with a flock, in Shoreham Harbour, and killed seventeen, being
nearly or quite all there were.&nbsp; They described them as
miniature ducks swimming swiftly about on the still water, and
did not attempt to escape; consequently they were all shot
down.</p>
<p>In very severe winters, immense flocks of Wild Fowl fly near
the shore, from east to west, and a great many specimens of the
Goose and Duck tribe are obtained, some of them very rare to this
county.&nbsp; The Egyptian Goose&mdash;<i>Anser
&aelig;gyptiacus</i>,&mdash;was shot a few miles from Brighton,
two years ago.&nbsp; So rare is this beautiful bird considered,
that there is still a doubt amongst Ornithologists that the
examples which have been met with, have only strayed from
gentlemen&rsquo;s parks, &amp;c.&nbsp; They have generally been
seen and shot in the severest winters, and are apparently a sort
of &ldquo;frozen-out gardeners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the winter of 1860, owing to its severity, several
specimens of the Hooper&mdash;<i>Cygnus musicus</i>,&mdash;and
Bewick&rsquo;s Swan&mdash;<i>Cygnus minor</i>,&mdash;were shot in
this neighbourhood.&nbsp; A great many Swans were likewise
observed flying a little distance out at sea.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The
Great Northern Diver&mdash;<i>Colymbus glacialis</i>&mdash;is
occasionally met with, as also the Black and Red Throated
Diver&mdash;<i>Colymbus arcticus</i>,&mdash;and <i>Colymbus
septentrionalis</i>.</p>
<p>There are several species of Terns to be met with in this
locality.&nbsp; The Gullbilled Tern&mdash;<i>Sterna
angelica</i>,&mdash;and the Lesser Tern&mdash;<i>Sterna
minuta</i>,&mdash;are both rare, particularly the former, and
have been shot near Shoreham.&nbsp; A few examples of the rare
Little Gull&mdash;<i>Larus minutus</i>,&mdash;have been shot near
Brighton; likewise the Ivory Gull&mdash;<i>Larus
eburneus</i>,&mdash;both very rare.&nbsp; Most of the common
Gulls are abundant, being near their breeding places.</p>
<p>Several specimens of The Forktailed
Petrel&mdash;<i>Thalassidroma Leachii</i>,&mdash;and of the Storm
Petrel or Mother Carey&rsquo;s Chicken&mdash;<i>Thalassidroma
pelagica</i>,&mdash;have been obtained generally in the severest
gales, about the time of the Vernal and Autumnal equinoxes, when
they have frequently been found blown ashore, by stress of
weather; and instances have occurred here, when they have been
picked up in areas of houses near the sea, generally in a most
exhausted state.</p>
<p>The House Sparrow,&mdash;<i>Fringilla domestica</i>,&mdash;is
a well-known young gentleman, that may be seen almost any day, at
every man&rsquo;s door, whether poor or rich, in town or in
country.&nbsp; He is the most familiar and domesticated wild bird
in England.&nbsp; In town he puts on his black, dirty,
scavenger&rsquo;s dress, which completely disguises
him,&mdash;his appearance being so different from his
<i>confreres</i> in the country.&nbsp; His destructiveness among
the newly sown seeds in the garden, and in the ripe standing
wheat, is proverbial;&mdash;but then, in the consumption of grubs
and caterpillars, he is eminently serviceable, which greatly
compensates for the harm he may do in the garden or in the
field.</p>
<p>The Rook&mdash;<i>Corvus frugilegus</i>,&mdash;during the
latter part of the Winter, the whole of the Spring, and the
former part of the Summer, takes up his abode in the elm trees of
the Pavilion Grounds, which form a breeding colony in immediate
connexion with the Rookery at Stanmer Park.&nbsp; About Christmas
the Rooks arrive to reconnoitre, and in February they commence
building their nests, much to the entertainment of persons whose
business or pleasure takes them by way of the New Road.&nbsp; For
some few years previous to the re-building of Union Street
Chapel, in 1825, a pair <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>of Rooks annually took up their
abode in a large elm tree which stood in the small burial-ground
of that place of worship.&nbsp; The Jackdaw&mdash;<i>Corvus
monedula</i>,&mdash;and the Starling&mdash;<i>Sturnus
vulgaris</i>,&mdash;in various parts of the town are annual
visitors, year after year occupying the same blank chimneys or
neglected gables.</p>
<p>All Naturalists attached to the scientific expeditions for the
exploration of the Arctic regions, speak of the myriads of water
fowl met with, in those immense reservoirs of snow and ice, the
accumulation of ages, where, in the midst of plenty, they rear
their young, unmolested by man.&nbsp; There, amongst lagoons, and
bays, and swamps, and lakes, and where an impenetrable barrier is
firmly fixed to the prying eye of man, they find an asylum to
propagate their different orders, and genus, and species,
surrounded by a profusion of food; and, at the end of the long
Summer day of weeks of unsetting sun, with instinctive knowledge
they gather together their separate families, in innumerable
flocks, and proceed southward, to replenish the warmer regions of
the globe, and to furnish man with some of the luxuries of
life.</p>
<p>Brighton and its surrounding locality, including Lewes, have
obtained considerable repute amongst entomologists for producing
a great many rare insects, owing, no doubt, to there being
several persevering and good collectors in the district.</p>
<p>There are only sixty-four indigenous Butterflies in
England,&mdash;certainly very few when compared with the number
of species found in Europe.&nbsp; Of those sixty-four, Brighton
and its neighbourhood contribute forty-eight, and of
Moths,&mdash;of which there are upwards of two thousand found in
England,&mdash;nearly the same proportion.&nbsp; It is a curious
fact in Natural History, that some families, which years ago were
rare in England, have now become common; and, others which were
frequently met with, are very rare; some species have disappeared
altogether, while new ones,&mdash;owing to the great addition and
perseverance of collectors,&mdash;are every year discovered and
added to the lists.</p>
<p>The Holmbush,&mdash;about eight miles from Brighton, and the
commencement of the Weald of Sussex,&mdash;has hitherto been the
great emporium for moths, and a good many butterflies,
particularly <i>the fritillaries</i>, whose resort is in and near
the large woods there.</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>A few
years ago, the Wood White,&mdash;<i>Leucophasia
sinapis</i>,&mdash;in June could be found there in
abundance.&nbsp; Now the species is rarely seen, but, being a
denizen of the interior of the woods, and the woods all about
there being strictly <i>tabooed</i>, the collector has not the
opportunity to get them he formerly had.</p>
<p>The Green-veined White,&mdash;<i>Pieris napi</i>,&mdash;the
pretty little Orange Tip,&mdash;<i>Anthocharis
cardamines</i>,&mdash;and the Brimstone
Butterfly,&mdash;<i>Gonepteryx rhamni</i>,&mdash;are common in
that locality; but for the Clouded Yellows,&mdash;genus,
<i>Colias</i>,&mdash;Brighton must be closer approached in the
clover fields, about August.&nbsp; They are of a rich golden
colour, banded with black; and there is a variety called
<i>Helice</i>, which are considered a prize to any
entomologist.&nbsp; <i>The</i> great prize, the Queen of
Spain,&mdash;<i>Argynnis lathonia</i>,&mdash;<i>has</i> been
taken in a garden at Kemp Town; but like &ldquo;Angels&rsquo;
visits,&rdquo; they are very &ldquo;few and far
between.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gorgeous Large
Copper,&mdash;<i>Polyommatus hippothoe</i>,&mdash;whose wings,
edged with black, shine like burnished gold, and cast into shade
any colour which the device of man can create,&mdash;was once
plentiful in two counties of England, Cambridgeshire and
Huntingdonshire; but it is now considered by our best
entomologists extinct in this country.</p>
<p>The Purple Emperor,&mdash;<i>Apatura iris</i>,&mdash;may be
seen in all his glory on a hot Summer&rsquo;s day, the first week
in August, in the above locality, soaring round the high oaks, in
all imaginable grandeur.&nbsp; He is rightly termed Emperor, as
no other butterfly dares to invade his imperial aerial
realms.&nbsp; His magnificent purple wings defy the highest skill
of the artist to imitate.&nbsp; These simple, beautiful
butterflies whisper in reason&rsquo;s ear, truths, which, alas!
humble the pride of man.&nbsp; There is the Painted
Lady,&mdash;<i>Vanessa Cardui</i>,&mdash;but she will not do for
the present fashionable generation, as she does not wear
crinoline, and her food is of the most vulgar
description,&mdash;the common thistle, from which she derives her
specific name.</p>
<p>The family of the Argus Butterflies,&mdash;the Hair
Streaks,&mdash;genus <i>Thecla</i>,&mdash;are of five distinct
species, three of which are obtained near Brighton.&nbsp; Their
haunts are likewise amongst the large oak trees, where they play
and gambol in the hot sunshine, the live-long day.&nbsp; The last
family of the butterflies are the Skippers,&mdash;in science,
<i>Hesperid&aelig;</i>,&mdash;or, to use the generic name for <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>this
family&mdash;<i>Hesperia</i>.&nbsp; The first is the
Grizzle&mdash;<i>Syrichthus elveolus</i>, whose specific name
means chequered, the spots on the wings of the Imago, being
somewhat like a chessboard, the fore wings being black,
interspersed with about fifteen or sixteen squarish white
spots.&nbsp; The next is the Dingy Skipper&mdash;<i>Hesperia
paniscus</i>,&mdash;and then the Large Skipper&mdash;<i>Hesperia
Sylvanus</i>,&mdash;from &ldquo;Sylvan,&rdquo;&mdash;being found
in the woods.&nbsp; The Pearl Skipper&mdash;<i>Hesperia
Comma</i>,&mdash;takes its name from a mark on the fore wings,
and is found in low swampy situations, and in almost every
locality for Butterflies.&nbsp; Then, there are the Small
Skipper&mdash;<i>Hesperia Linia</i>,&mdash;and the Lulworth
Skipper&mdash;<i>Hesperia Acteon</i>.&nbsp; The latter derives
its English name from the only place where it has been found,
viz., near Lulworth Cove, on the Dorsetshire Coast; and it
receives its Latin name, Acteon, from his being a great
hunter.</p>
<p>This ends the list of the British Butterflies in the vicinity
of Brighton, with the exception of that which was taken by one of
the most honest and persevering collectors, in August, 1860, near
Kemp Town.&nbsp; No one doubts of its being taken there, as
several entomologists of the highest respectability, saw it on
the spot <i>alive</i>, immediately after it was taken; but a very
small clique of savans will not allow it to be put on the list as
a new British Butterfly, because they have a theoretic fancy that
it might be blown over from the coast of France, a distance of
nearly a hundred miles, across the English Channel.&nbsp; The
idea, however, is absurd.&nbsp; A little delicate butterfly, with
all the appearance of having just emerged from the chrysalis, to
be blown that distance without apparently ruffling a feather, is
out of all character.&nbsp; If it had been a new bird that had
been obtained on our shores, the ornithologists would have been
only too happy to have had the opportunity of adding it to their
list, as a new British species.</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Newman, of Bishopsgate Street, the great
naturalist, and prince of writers, and publisher of works on
Natural History, has stood sponsor to this new British Butterfly,
and named it&mdash;The Brighton Argos&mdash;<i>Lycaena
B&oelig;tica</i>.</p>
<p>Bewick has expressed the wish that mankind could be prevailed
upon to read a few lessons from the great book of Nature, to see
the wonders which the Universe presents, and to reflect <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>on the
wisdom, the power, and the goodness of the Great Creator that
planned and formed the whole.</p>
<p>How necessary is it, then, that we should direct our attention
to the sowing of the seeds of knowledge in the minds of
youth.&nbsp; The great work of forming the man cannot be begun
too early; and agreeably with this sentiment, how many writers
are there who spend their lives in contributing in various ways
to turn the streams of instruction through their proper channel
into this most improvable soil,&mdash;taking children by the
hand, and directing their steps like guardian angels, in the
outset of life, to prevent their floundering on in ignorance to
the end.&nbsp; In these undertakings the instructors of youth are
often assisted by the fertile genius of the artists, who supply
their works with such embellishments as serve to relieve the
lengthened sameness of the way.&nbsp; Among the many approved
branches of instruction, the study of Natural History holds a
distinguished rank.&nbsp; To enlarge upon the advantages which
are desirable from a knowledge of the Creation, is surely not
necessary.&nbsp; To become initiated into this knowledge is to
become enamoured of its charms; to attain the object in view
requires but little previous study or labour; the road which
leads to it soon becomes strewed with flowers, and ceases to
fatigue; a flow is given to the imagination which banishes early
prejudices and expands the ideas, and an endless fund of the most
rational entertainment is spread out, that captivates the
attention and exalts the mind.&nbsp; For the attainment of this
science in any of its various departments, the foundation may be
laid, insensibly, in youth, whereon a goodly superstructure of
useful knowledge can easily be raised at a more advanced
period.&nbsp; In whatever way, indeed, the varied objects of this
beautiful world are viewed, they are readily understood by the
contemplative mind, for they are found alike to be the visible
works of God.&nbsp; The great book of Nature is amply spread out
before mankind, and could they but see how clearly the hand of
Providence is in every page, they would consider the faculty of
reason as the distinguishing gift to the human race, and use it
as the guide of their lives.&nbsp; They would find their reward
in a cheerful resignation of mind, in peace and happiness, under
the conscious persuasion that &ldquo;a good naturalist cannot be
a bad man.&rdquo;</p>

THE WILD FLOWERS AND MOSSES ABOUT BRIGHTON.</h2>
<p>To an unobservant eye the vicinity of Brighton possesses no
wild vegetable productions worthy of notice, and, apart from the
cultivated fields, all else appears a barren waste, save and
except the short sweet verdure whereon our favourite South-Down
flocks luxuriate.&nbsp; Upon peering, however, into the
hedgerows, and the waysides and the furrows, a volume is opened
to the student of Botany, and there is that whereon he may
sumptuously feast.&nbsp; Fifty years since, the observation that
&ldquo;Brighton was a place without trees,&rdquo; was a truism;
but since then, irrespective of the success in planting the
Squares, Enclosures, Steines, and the ornamental gardens of
private residences in the town, where formerly, only hardy
tamarisk grew, belts and copses of thriving trees have reared
their towering heads, and the elm, fir, sycamore, horse-chesnut,
larch, beech, hazel, birch, hawthorn, and the holly and other
evergreens, having, by culture, become acclimatised, thrive so
well as to induce the belief that they are indigenous to the
South East Coast.</p>
<p>Immediately along our sea-shore, to the westward, upon leaving
the grass-plot at Adelaide Crescent, a low trailing plant is met
with, and is more or less abundant at some distance beyond the
reach of the tide, as far as the lock of the Shoreham Harbour
Canal, at Fishersgate.&nbsp; It is known as the
Orach&mdash;<i>Atriplea postulcoides</i>,&mdash;and has succulent
silvery leaves, upon a woody stem.&nbsp; The Yellow Horned
Poppy&mdash;<i>Glacium luteum</i>,&mdash;is equally abundant in
the same localities, and a few years since was very thriving on
the sites of Adelaide Terrace, Mills&rsquo;s Terrace, and the
houses adjacent.&nbsp; Its leaves are sea-green, and its flowers
are of a pale yellow, resulting in long seed pods.&nbsp; It has a
tap root, which, on being broken, exudes an acrid juice.&nbsp; A
species of Samphire, or Jointed Glasswort, grows in profusion
about the pools in the vicinity of Copperasgap.&nbsp; It is
gathered and pickled; but it is altogether of a different
character to the Samphire which is gathered on the cliffs of the
Isle of Wight, and at Dover.&nbsp; Thrift Grass, about the wide
expanse of the beach in the vicinity of the Canal Basin,
flourishes in extensive <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>patches, and its lilac flowers are a
pleasing relief to the eye during the bright rays of the meridian
sun in Summer.&nbsp; The most prolific plant in this
neighbourhood is the Stonecrop, known by the several names,
Ginger, Wall-pepper, and Gold-chain.&nbsp; It is leafless, and
grows as it were, in links, from which issue golden flowers of
dazzling brightness.&nbsp; The vitality of this little plant is
incredible, and, like the several species of the <i>Cacti</i>, it
absorbs and retains a vast amount of moisture.&nbsp; It may be
propagated from very small portions of the plant.&nbsp; A dwarf
kind of the Bitter Sweet Nightshade&mdash;<i>Solanum
dulcamara</i>,&mdash;abounds in the same locality.&nbsp; It
differs from the Deadly Nightshade, the former having purple
flowers and yellow stamens; whereas the latter bears a large
cup-shaped flower.&nbsp; The berries of both are poisonous.&nbsp;
A rough hairy plant, the Viper&rsquo;s Bugloss&mdash;<i>Echium
vulgare</i>,&mdash;also grows here.&nbsp; It bears large and
handsome purple or blue flowers.&nbsp; A very common plant along
the banks of the Canal, and likewise on the banks of the shelving
cliffs, between Hove and Kingston, is the Sea Starwort, or
Michaelmas Daisy&mdash;<i>Aster tripolium</i>.&nbsp; It is of the
same kind as that which formerly was so common in flower
gardens.&nbsp; Another plant which grows abundantly about here,
is the Common Mallow&mdash;<i>Malva sylvestris</i>,&mdash;and
bears purple flowers, succeeded by seeds, well-known amongst
children as &ldquo;cheeses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Formerly, the whole
range of the dwarf cliff from Russell Street to Hove, abounded
with the Common Mallow, the leaves of which possess valuable
properties when boiled and applied as a poultice to
whitlows.&nbsp; There also, as many an ass well knew, the Milk
Thistle&mdash;<i>Carduus marianus</i>,&mdash;which was formerly
held sacred to the Virgin Mary, was very prolific.&nbsp;
Specimens of it may be found now upon the banks south of the
turnpike road beyond Hove.&nbsp; Some years since, some rare
roots of this superbly prickly plant protected the bank which
forms the northern side of the cricket ground belonging to Hove
House School.&nbsp; It may be known by the white streaks on its
leaves.&nbsp; The unfinished embankment between the Chain Pier
and Kemp Town is a fine nursery for this thistle, emblematical of
the amazing quantity of the same species which occupied the
rugged slopes that formed some portions of the East Cliff, now
the Marine Parade, before the erection of the sea wall.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>The
other plants along the sea-side are the Wild
Beetroot&mdash;<i>Beta maritima</i>,&mdash;bearing greenish white
flowers on a straggling stem, with a large root; the Sea-side
Campion, or Catchfly, a white trailing flower with a globular
calyx and dark stamens; the Starry-headed
Clover&mdash;<i>Trifolium stellatum</i>,&mdash;the Tree
Mallow&mdash;<i>Lavater arborea</i>, and three species of
Plaintain&mdash;the Common Plaintain, with acorn shaped seeds
grouped up a rat-tailed stem, the kind given to birds; the
Ribwort Plantain, bearing similar seeds, borne in a cluster at
the end of a similar stem; and the Buck&rsquo;s-horn Plantain, so
called from the irregular shape of the leaves, resembling a
stag&rsquo;s horn, with the seeds like the other kinds.</p>
<p>In the fields in general, about Brighton, is the Scentless
Mayweed&mdash;<i>Matricaria inodorata</i>,&mdash;with a large
radiating flower like a daisy, having a yellow centre and white
outside.&nbsp; The simple, yet pretty Daisy abounds about the
general field herbage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Daisies, the flowers of lowly birth,<br />
Embroiderers of the carpet earth,<br />
That stud the velvet sod.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most prolific source of the wild flowers near Brighton is
the plantation on the Dyke Road, upon the estate of Lady
Ogle.&nbsp; There</p>
<blockquote><p>The Violet in her greenwood bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where birchen boughs with hazels mingle,<br />
May boast herself the fairest flower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In glen, or copse, or forest dingle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the Sweet Violet&mdash;<i>Viola odorata</i>,&mdash;and
the Dog Violet&mdash;<i>Viola canina</i>,&mdash;grow there, the
latter in profusion.&nbsp; The Wild Heartsease&mdash;<i>Viola
tricolor</i>,&mdash;is not to be found there; but it abounds in
the hedge-rows about Preston, where also the Sweet Violet may be
found.&nbsp; In this plantation are the several kinds of
Nightshade; the Bitter-sweet, as before described; the Black
Nightshade&mdash;<i>Solanum nigrum</i>,&mdash;a rare species in
this district; and the Deadly Nightshade&mdash;<i>Atropa
belladonna</i>,&mdash;which may be known by its large dark
tobacco-leaf shaped leaves, cup-shaped purple flowers, and
cherry-like fruit, the produce of a root,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">That takes the reason
prisoner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the easy access to this plantation, and other
copses where this death-plant flourishes, and reflecting upon the
natural <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>proneness of children to pilfer and consume all within
their reach, when they are upon their marauding expeditions, it
is really surprising that there are not numerous instances of
poisoning by misadventure.&nbsp; It can be but the special
Providence, which it is presumed watches over children, that
prevents the tasting of the forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>The Black Bryony&mdash;<i>Tamus communis</i>,&mdash;thrives
here to perfection.&nbsp; Its flowers are of a greenish yellow,
but its berries, like the Nightshade, are poisonous.&nbsp; The
Geranium&mdash;<i>Geraniace&aelig;</i>,&mdash;signifying
Crane&rsquo;s Bill,&mdash;from the seed vessel and pistil
resembling a crane&rsquo;s head and bill,&mdash;may be found here
of three distinct species.&nbsp; Each, being in its wild state,
is very diminutive; but they all are as perfect in their form and
colours as the most highly cultivated of the genus.&nbsp; In the
hedges by the London Road, just beyond Preston, the Lewes Road,
beyond the Cavalry Barracks, and Preston Drove, the
Dove&rsquo;s-foot Geranium,&mdash;<i>Geranium
molle</i>,&mdash;vegetates.&nbsp; Its flowers are pink or purple,
and its leaves, which grow in clusters, are flat, and velvety to
the touch.</p>
<p>An English species of the Arum Lily is very common in this and
other plantations, and in the damp and shady hedge-rows to the
north of Brighton.&nbsp; Its leaves are of a dark green, spotted
with purple, and it has, instead of a flower, a sort of leaf,
containing a green spadix, which is also purple.&nbsp; The stem
of this leaf has a ring of glands, beneath which are anthers and
ovaries, which, as the plant matures, are succeeded by scarlet
berries, that are commonly known as Lords and Ladies.&nbsp; The
plant yields an acrid juice, which is very poisonous; and about
eighteen years since, a servant girl at the Synagogue, in
Devonshire place, unwittingly poisoned herself, in consequence of
eating some Lords and Ladies.&nbsp; The juice, mixed with
vinegar, was formerly taken as an antidote against the plague,
and even against other poisons.</p>
<p>The two species of Stitchwort, the Lesser&mdash;<i>Stellaria
graminea</i>,&mdash;and the Greater&mdash;<i>Stellaria
holostea</i>, or satin flower,&mdash;grow on the bank by the Dyke
Road copse.&nbsp; Both kinds are beautiful star-like wild
flowers.&nbsp; And, a little further on, the Wild
Marjoram&mdash;<i>Origanum vulgare</i>,&mdash;is very plentiful
amongst the furze that dots the <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>green sward.&nbsp; Buttercups and
cowslips grow plentifully in the Hove fields, and in the meadows
which abut the railway at Preston.</p>
<p>The three several species of Nettle are met with in various
localities.&nbsp; The largest is the Roman Nettle&mdash;<i>Urtica
pilulifera</i>,&mdash;from the pill-like shape of the
flowers,&mdash;formidable in its appearance, and pungent to the
touch.&nbsp; The next is the Common Nettle, with which most
persons are conversant; and the other species is the Burning
Nettle&mdash;<i>Urtica ureus</i>,&mdash;which grows about a foot
high, and whose leaves are a very dark green.&nbsp; All these
species have a venomous sting of a hair-like character, which
possesses at its root a poisonous bulb that discharges itself
when the sting is pressed gently.&nbsp; When, however, the stings
are grasped firmly, the fine points become bent or broken, and
are thus rendered harmless.&nbsp; They point upwards, so that if
the hand be passed up the plant briskly the sting is
ineffectual.&nbsp; The Dead Nettle&mdash;<i>Lamium
album</i>,&mdash;has no sting.&nbsp; Its flowers are white,
whereas the blossoms of the stinging Nettles are green.</p>
<p>The hedge-rows of the Hove and Preston Droves are composed
principally of Brambles, Dog-wood, the Wild Rose, a species of
willow, called Palm; Black Horehound, Traveller&rsquo;s Joy,
Alder, Ash, and Ivy.&nbsp; By the pathway on the upper road to
Shoreham, and on the London, Ditchling, Lewes, and Dyke roads,
just upon the outskirts of Brighton, the Burdock&mdash;<i>Arctium
lappa</i>,&mdash;commonly called the Dock, thrives amidst burdens
of dust.&nbsp; The flower is purple, and is thrown out from a
ball, after the manner of the bloom of the Corn Flower.&nbsp; A
thistle-like cone succeeds, and forms a means for amusement to
schoolboys, who gather them and stick them on persons&rsquo;
clothes.</p>
<p>The Wall Pellitory&mdash;<i>Parietaria
officinalis</i>,&mdash;which has reddish stalks and flowers, and
hairy leaves, yields a cooling extract.&nbsp; It is found in
different localities, but does not require much nutriment for its
dwarf growth.&nbsp; The Shepherd&rsquo;s Purse, so called from
its heart-shaped seed pods, resembling old-fashioned money
purses, is found growing about most hedged-in fields.&nbsp; On
many of the hillocks upon the meadow land Knot Grass is very
prevalent.&nbsp; It may be found also amongst the vegetation
between the carriage road and pathway just beyond Preston.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>On
the Ditchling Road, and the Roman Encampment on Hollingbury Hill,
Wild Mignionette, Heath, Thyme, Gentian, Whitlow-grass, Carline
and Plume Thistle, and Hawkweed grow in profusion; and in the
fields immediately south of the pond there, Dandelion,
Adam&rsquo;s Needles, Centaury, Convolvulus, Yellow Snapdragon,
Yarrow, Cockle, Perriwinkle, Poppy, Milkwort, Dropwort, Cropwort,
Fleabane, Yellowwort, Henbane, and Groundsell form a pleasing
diversity; while, in the copses contiguous, the Rock Rose and the
Sun Rose give their Summer refreshing odours.</p>
<p>In speaking of the Mosses in the vicinity of Brighton, the
area will be restricted to the range of the Downs in which the
Town is placed, and the coast line of the same distance.&nbsp;
Therefore, assuming the limit to be bounded on the east by the
Cliffs as far as Newhaven, and the Downs that slope to the west
side of the river Ouse, and gradually heighten until passing
Lewes, Offham and its chalk-pits are reached.&nbsp; Following,
then, the base of the hills by the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke, and the
Fulking Downs to Beeding, and thence continuing the marginal line
to Shoreham, a tract of country will be embraced, that will be
bounded on the south by the sea-shore.&nbsp; Thus, the sandstone
plants, and those found in arenaceous soil will be represented by
the species from the banks on the beach, near Aldrington Basin,
and a few from the tertiary sandstone at Newhaven
Cliffs&mdash;chalk, clay, and argillaceous soils determining the
remaining species.</p>

<p><i>Tortula Hornschuchiana</i>, <i>Orthotrichum rupestre</i>,
and <i>Orthotrichum Ludwigii</i>, <i>Bryum torquescens</i>,
<i>Eurynchium circinnatum</i>, and <i>Eurynchium striatulum</i>
have been found by Mr. Mitten only, about Woolsonbury Hill.</p>
<p>The plants growing on chalk, are: <i>Seligeria calcarea</i>,
on inclined faces of chalk pits, and occasionally on detached
chalk.&nbsp; <i>Seligeria calcicola</i>, in similar situations on
Woolsonbury.&nbsp; This is nearly allied to <i>Seligeria
pusilla</i>, and has the capsule always ovate.&nbsp;
<i>Anacalypta caespitoso</i> in some seasons is in plenty on
Woolsonbury.&nbsp; Only two localities are known in Sussex, and
it is not found elsewhere in Britain.&nbsp; <i>Bryum
intermedium</i> is frequent in chalk pits, and remarkable for
having the fruit on the same tuft in all stages of
maturity.&nbsp; <i>Encalypta streptocarpa</i>, Woolsonbury, under
beech trees.&nbsp; <i>Neckera crispa</i>, on Woolsonbury and
Newtimber; in fruit on the first hill.&nbsp; <i>Cylindrothecium
Montagnei</i>, Saddlescombe.&nbsp; <i>Rhyncostegium
depressum</i>, Newtimber woods.&nbsp; <i>Hypnum polymorphum</i>,
Patcham embankment.&nbsp; <i>Hypnum chrysophyllum</i>, common
everywhere.&nbsp; <i>Eurynchium circinnatum</i>, Clayton.</p>
<p>The clay summits of the hills, as at Woolsonbury, give
<i>Phascum alternifolium</i> and <i>Weissia mucronata</i>, and
<i>Physcomitrium fasciculare</i> on Pyecombe downs.&nbsp;
<i>Racomitrium canescens</i> is frequent in similar <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>localities,
and fruited on Woolsonbury in December, 1858.&nbsp; <i>Tortula
subulata</i> and <i>Eurynchium hians</i> are also frequent, the
latter differing from <i>Eurynchium Swartzii</i>, its near ally,
in its wider, not acuminate, leaves.</p>
<p>The stiff soils of the hills furnish <i>Phascum rectum</i>,
<i>Phascum curvicollum</i>, <i>Astomum crispum</i>,
<i>Gymnostomum microstomum</i>, <i>Pottia minutula</i>,
<i>Anacalypta lanceolata</i>, <i>Didymodon luridus</i>,
<i>Tortula convoluta</i>, also <i>Phascum bryoides</i> in disused
roads.</p>
<p>A rivulet at Grin Gap, near Newhaven, with its miniature
ravine, gives <i>Webera albicans</i>, in fruit, <i>Trichostomum
topnaceum</i>, and <i>Hypnum riparium</i>.</p>
<p>On the cliffs, east of Brighton, are found <i>Acaulon
triquetrum</i>, the only British locality for this; also,
<i>Gymnostomum tortile</i>, the <i>var &#223; subcylindricum</i>
of which occurs on a hill near Greenway Station, <i>Phascum
curvicollum</i>, <i>Pottia cavifolia</i>, <i>Trichostomum
mutabile</i>, and <i>Trichostomum crispulum</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Anacalypta Starkeana</i>, <i>&#223; brachyodus</i>, are all
frequent, and <i>Webera carnea</i>, at Black Rock.</p>
<p>The sides of Woolsonbury have numerous species, as
follows;&mdash;<i>Phascum bryoides var &gamma;</i>, <i>Archidium
phascoides</i>, <i>Fissidens adiantoides</i>, <i>Dicranum
palustre</i>, <i>Hypnum molluscum</i>, <i>Brachythecium
glareosum</i>, <i>Bryum bimum</i>, <i>Bryum
pseudo-triquetrum</i>, <i>Bryum roseum</i>, and <i>Bryum
Billarderii</i>; this last plant is exceedingly rare.&nbsp; It is
the only known British locality, and it is not known to have been
gathered elsewhere north of the Colosseum at Rome.</p>
<p><i>Brachythecium campestre</i> is common in fields among
grass, differing from <i>Brachythecium rutubulum</i> by its
gradually tapering, not suddenly acuminate leaves.&nbsp; <i>Bryum
capillare &#223; flaccidum</i> is found in a field in Newtimber
valley.&nbsp; On walls <i>Tortula vinealis</i>, <i>Tortula
revoluta</i>, <i>Tortula rupestris</i>, <i>Grimmia pulvinata</i>,
<i>Orthotrichum saxatile</i>, <i>Orthotrichum diaphanum</i>, and
<i>Rhyncostegium tenellum</i>, are luxuriant; but <i>Bryum
sanguineum</i> is rare.</p>
<p>In Poynings springs <i>Mnium affine</i> and <i>Hypnum
filicinum</i> are frequent.&nbsp; In the stubble fields at
Aldrington are found <i>Acaulon Florkeanum</i> and <i>Acaulon
muticum</i>, and in the near hedge-banks, <i>Anacalypta
Starkeana</i>, <i>Tortula insulana</i>, <i>Bryum Donianum</i>,
<i>Scleropodium illecebrum</i>.&nbsp; Once, in November, 1858,
the very rare fruit of <i>Eurynchium piliferum</i> was
gathered.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Around Aldrington Basin are seen <i>Tortula

denticulatum</i>, <i>Plagiothecium sylvaticum</i>, <i>Eurynchium
Swartzii</i>, and all the species of <i>Hylocomium</i>: the last
mentioned abundantly, with capsules, at Clayton.&nbsp; On
detached ash trees at the feet of the hills, <i>Orthotrichum
tenellum</i>, <i>Orthotrichum pulchellum</i>, and <i>Tortula
papillosa</i> are not unfrequent.&nbsp; On beech stems about
Woolsonbury, <i>Zygodon viridissimus</i> fruits freely, and a
most diminutive state of <i>Schistidium apocarpum</i> is
seen.</p>
<p>The Mosses already indicated are not the only species found on
these soils; for, on the Arundel Downs, precisely similar in
formation to those of our range, <i>Encalyta vulgaris</i>,
<i>Antitrichia curtipendula</i>, <i>Thrudium abietinum</i> and
some others may be met with.</p>
<p>In proof of the extreme beauty of the form of these objects
and the marvellous design of our Great Creator, a more positive
instance of the perfection of vegetable organization could not be
adduced than <i>Acoulon Florkeanum</i>.&nbsp; Taking a single
plant, radicles are found, corresponding to roots in flowering
plants, at the bottom of the stem.&nbsp; Next rise the
overlapping leaves, disposed, for instance, as are those of the
lettuce.&nbsp; When these leaves are dissected off, the stem is
exposed to view, consisting of a pedicle with a capsule at the
top, terminating in an oblique apiculus or small point, and
covered by a membrane, called a calyptra, or hood.&nbsp; And
clustering around the base of the pedicle are the sexual
flowers.&nbsp; The whole plant does not exceed the sixteenth of
an inch in height and width, the size of a small pin&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>Thus, after enumerating most, if not all the Wild Flowers and
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Mosses
which attach themselves to the natural history of Brighton, we
may say,</p>
<blockquote><p>Beautiful children of the glen and dell,&mdash;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; The dingle deep&mdash;the moorland stretching
wide,<br />
And of the mossy fountain&rsquo;s sedgy side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye, o&rsquo;er my heart have thrown a lovesome
spell.<br />
And though the worldling, scorning way deride&mdash;<br />

BRIGHTON CAMP AND THE TRAGEDIES OF GOLDSTONE BOTTOM.</h2>
<p>The hills and the vales about Brighton, have more than a
natural history in connexion with the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, to give them a feature in the nation&rsquo;s
chronicles.&nbsp; Not the least important events have been the
Camps, lyrically handed to posterity by one of the most martial
and spirit-stirring pieces extant, the &ldquo;Brighton Camp, or,
the Girl I left behind me,&rdquo; music that seems inherent to
drums and fifes.</p>
<p>Although &ldquo;Brighton Camp&rdquo; is the familiar term
used, it must be understood that there have been several Camps
held here.&nbsp; The first was in 1793, and was formed on
Tuesday, August 13th.&nbsp; The troops composing it the previous
morning at three o&rsquo;clock, struck their tents on Ashdown
Forest, from which they marched at five, and reached Chailey
Common at half-past eleven.&nbsp; There they pitched their tents
for the night.&nbsp; On the Tuesday morning at four
o&rsquo;clock, they were again on the march, and at noon they
arrived on the hills over Brighton.&nbsp; The baggage, part of
the heavy artillery, and the corps of artificers, marched by way
of Lewes; but the army in general, consisting of about 7,000 men,
took their route over the South Downs.&nbsp; By two o&rsquo;clock
the Camp had formed in the presence of the Prince of Wales, who
met them as they came over the hill.&nbsp; The left of the
encampment was close to the town, in Belle-Vue Field,&mdash;now
Regency square,&mdash;and stretched in a direct <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>line along
the coast.&nbsp; The encampment, which increased to 10,000
troops, was composed of regulars and militia, and was continued,
on account of some apprehensions of an invasion by the New
Republic of France, till the 28th of October.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, during the time of the encampment,
there was a Sham Fight.&nbsp; Its plan was, an enemy attacking
Brighton and the Camp.&nbsp; The enemy consisted of eight
regiments of infantry, with their battalion guns, under General
Sir William Howe; while four battalions of infantry, the light
horse, and the mounted artillery, defended the country.&nbsp;
Brighton was denominated Dunkirk, and was of course taken by the
British.&nbsp; But one prisoner was captured, an officer of the
East Middlesex, by his own Major, after a stout resistance, for
the offence of sitting on a drum, during the inactivity that
generally prevails for hours in the field.&nbsp; The officer was
put under arrest, but the next day he was liberated.</p>
<p>The Camp of 1794, was formed early in the summer, about a mile
and a half to the west of the town.&nbsp; It consisted at first,
of 7,000 men; but when the harvest was got in, it was increased
to nearly 15,000, as the militia regiments were not called out
till the crops were cleared, the men then composing the militia
corps being principally agricultural labourers.&nbsp; On the
breaking up of this Camp many of the regiments remained in
Barracks at Brighton.&nbsp; The Barracks then were in West
Street, at the corner of Little Russel Street, afterwards the
Custom House; in North Street, on property now known as the
Unicorn Yard,&mdash;Windsor Street; and in Church Street, the
present Infantry Barracks.</p>
<p>Nothing of any particular importance took place during this
Camp.&nbsp; But that of the following year will ever be memorable
in the history of Brighton, inasmuch as it is connected with the
trial and execution of two men and the flogging of several others
for mutiny.&nbsp; Not that the mutiny took place here, but
Brighton was the military head quarters of the troops, hence the
Court Martial was held in the town.</p>
<p>East Blatchington, near Newhaven, was the theatre of the
disaffection, arising from the shortness and bad quality of the
bread and flour supplied to the troops; in consequence of which,
some men of the Oxford Militia broke into the mill in the
vicinity of the <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>barracks, and also, in a rebellious mood, emptied the
contents of a vessel laden with corn, into the river, at
Newhaven.&nbsp; The Court Martial was held at the Castle Tavern,
which occupied the site whereon now stand the buildings which
form the north-east corner of Castle Square.&nbsp; The trial
occupied eight days; and ended in Edward Cooke,&mdash;termed
Captain Cooke, from his taking the lead in the mutiny,&mdash;and
Henry Parish being found guilty and sentenced to be shot.&nbsp;
Six others were also convicted, but their sentence was only that
they should be flogged.&nbsp; Much sympathy was shown by the
inhabitants to the poor fellows, who were each day marched under
a strong escort, from the guard house of the Battery, Artillery
Place, to the Castle and back.&nbsp; Many of the residents in
Russell Street, every night and morning took them provisions,
which they were able to pass to them through the bars of their
airing ground; and on the morning of the execution of the
sentence upon them the wretched men were unable, from their
emotion, to express their thanks for the kindness the people
showed them.</p>
<p>From the hour of four in the morning of the day appointed for
them to suffer, the whole lines of encampment were ordered to
hold themselves in readiness; at five, however, in the evening,
the officers were given to understand that the execution was
countermanded for that day.&nbsp; The cause of this short respite
was attributed to the absence of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s 10th
Regiment of Light Dragoons, afterwards the 10th Hussars, which
did not march into Brighton till nine o&rsquo;clock on the
following morning, and of course could not pitch their tents till
late in the evening.&nbsp; When this regiment was seen on the
march to their station, all hopes of an expected reprieve seemed
entirely to vanish.&nbsp; The most respectable people, however,
of Brighton took this opportunity of one day&rsquo;s delay, to
repeat their petition in favour of the two men; but all proved
ineffectual, for early on the 13th June, 1795, the Oxford
Militia&mdash;the regiment to which the mutineers
belonged,&mdash;began their march from the Barracks at
Blatchington to Brighton, to be made awful spectators of their
unhappy comrades&rsquo; punishment, and to be their
executioners.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock the whole were ordered
to accompany them from the ground to Goldstone Bottom, at which
place they arrived about five.&nbsp; The six men&mdash;for there
were <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>thirteen mutineers,&mdash;that were sentenced to be
flogged, proceeded afterwards in a covered waggon, guarded by a
strong escort, which was composed of select men, picked from
every regiment of the line.&nbsp; The two condemned to be shot
followed in the rear in an open cart, attended by the Rev. Mr.
Dring, and guarded by a second escort, under the command of
Captain Leigh, of the 10th Regiment of Light Dragoons, and one of
the Captains belonging to the Lancashire Fencibles.&nbsp; When
they arrived, however, at the winding road which leads to
Goldstone Bottom,&mdash;or Vale,&mdash;which is surrounded by an
eminence, both the escorts were commanded to halt.&nbsp; The six
men sentenced to be flogged were then taken from the covered
waggon, and, having been marched through the entire line, which
was under arms to receive them, they were brought back to a
whipping-post, that was fixed in the centre of the different
regiments.&nbsp; The drummers selected to flog them were men
belonging to their own corps.&nbsp; To three of them were given
three hundred lashes each.&nbsp; This was the number they then
received, as, from their long durance, and consequent weakness,
the surgeon pronounced that they could suffer no more.&nbsp; The
fourth was then stripped, and, after being tied to the
flogging-post, was reprieved, as were also his two other
comrades.</p>
<p>This part of the distressing ceremony being gone through, the
two unfortunate men condemned to be shot were taken from the cart
and marched, as the others had been, up the line, with this
difference only, of being conducted also through part of the
outer line, which was composed of the Prince&rsquo;s Regiment,
and the Lancashire and Cinque Port Fencibles.&nbsp; They were
then marched to the front of the Oxfordshire Militia, where the
coffins stood to receive their bodies, the Artillery being
planted on the right, with lighted matches, in the rear of the
Oxfordshire, to prevent any mutiny, if attempted, and the whole
height commanded by two thousand cavalry.</p>
<p>Cooke and Parish being conducted to the fatal spot, exchanged
a few words with the clergyman, and then kneeled, with the
greatest composure and firmness, on their coffins; the first
time, however, they kneeled, it was done the wrong way, but being
placed in a proper situation they received their death from a <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>delinquent
platoon of twelve of their own regiment, at the distance only of
six paces.&nbsp; One of them was not quite dead when he fell, and
was therefore shot through the head with a pistol.&nbsp; This,
however, was not the last awful ceremony the line had to
experience; for, to conclude the dreadful tragedy, every regiment
on the ground was ordered to file off past the bodies before they
were suffered to be enclosed in their coffins.&nbsp; The whole
scene was impressibly awful beyond any spectacle of the kind ever
exhibited.</p>
<p>No disturbance whatever resulted from the melancholy affair;
everything was conducted with the greatest solemnity and order:
the awe and silence that reigned on the occasion infused a
terror, mingled with an equal degree of pity, that was
distressing beyond conception.&nbsp; The Oxfordshire Militia
naturally experienced more afflicting sensations than any other
regiment on the ground.</p>
<p>Cooke and Parish were both young men, and behaved with
uncommon firmness and resignation; they marched through the lines
with a steady step, and regarded their coffins with an undaunted
eye.</p>
<p>On the morning of his execution Cooke wrote to his brother a
letter, the original of which is in the possession of the author
of this book.&nbsp; It is written in a free and bold style, very
different to what might be expected from a man under sentence and
at the point of an ignominious death.&nbsp; The following is a
correct copy, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, of the
original:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Brighton, 13th of June,
1795.</p>
<p>Dear Brother,&mdash;This comes with my kind Love to you, and I
hope you be well.&nbsp; I am brought very low and weak by long
confinement and been in great trouble.&nbsp; Dear
Brother,&mdash;I am sentenced Death, and must Die on Saturday,
the 13th of June; and I hope God Almighty will forgive me my
Sins.&nbsp; I never was no body&rsquo;s foe but my own, and that
was in Drinking and breaking the Sabbath, and that is a great
Sin.&nbsp; I have prayed night and Day to the Almighty God to
forgive me and take me to Heaven, and I hope my prayers be not in
vain.&nbsp; I am going to die for what the Redgment done; I am
not afraid to meet Death, for I have done no harm to no person,
and that is a great comfort to me: there is a just God in heaven
that knows I am going to suffer innocently.&nbsp; Dear
Brother,&mdash;I should be very glad to see you before I Depart
this Life.&nbsp; I hope God Almighty will be a Guardian over you
and all my relations, and I hope we shall meet in heaven, where
we shall be ever happy without End.&nbsp; So no more from the
hand of your ever loving and Dying Brother,</p>

<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>A
print extant of the execution of these misguided men, is in the
possession of Mr. Benjamin Kent, the landlord of the Good Intent
Inn, Russell Street.&nbsp; It is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Awful Scene or Ceremony of the Two
Soldiers belonging to the Oxfordshire Militia, which were shot on
June 13th, 1795, in a Vale, while in Camp at Brighton, by a party
of the Oxfordshire Militia which were very Active in the late
riots, the men appeared very composed and resigned, the party
which shot them were much affected, Infantry, and Artillery, were
drawn up in lines on the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The engraving, which is about 18 inches by 15 inches,
represents the men kneeling on their coffins, the figure
signifying Cooke being in the attitude of prayer, with clasped
hands and a firm countenance; while Parish, though with his hands
clasped denoting his devotion, is dejected in his general
position and has downcast looks.&nbsp; Three lines of four men
each are at &ldquo;present,&rdquo; the front rank kneeling, while
at each side of the men to be executed is a man at
&ldquo;ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Dring, who is in his
clerical robes, is departing from the scene towards the rising
ground to the right, at the foot of which is an infantry regiment
at &ldquo;attention,&rdquo; with the 10th Regiment of Light
Dragoons at then rear.&nbsp; On the crown of the hill are the
civilians, male and female; in front of whom, to the right, are
soldiers formed in a circle, within which, at a triangle, is a
man undergoing the punishment of the lash, an officer, evidently
the surgeon, superintending the proceedings.&nbsp; Immediately in
the rear are the tents of the encampment.</p>
<p>Thirteen regiments were present at the execution, which for
nearly fifty years was pointed out by the form of the coffins,
the positions of the men firing, and other incidents of the
scene, being cut out in the turf by the shepherd, whose innocent
flocks browsed where so tragic an affair occurred.&nbsp; The
plough has since obliterated all traces of the tragedy from the
spot.</p>
<p>A singular instance of the effect of nervous excitement is
connected with the execution.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Dring, the
Chaplain of the regiment, who attended the culprits in their last
moments, being a nervous man, and having a great horror of the
duty which he had to perform, made a special request that after
he had administered to them the last religious consolation, he
should have sufficient time to get beyond the sound of the report
of the fatal muskets before the <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>order to fire was given.&nbsp;
Promise of compliance with his request was made; but either from
his tardy progress in leaving the spot, or a miscalculation of
time, the word of command was given, and the firing took place
while he yet was within hearing.&nbsp; The effect upon him was
that he fell to the ground, and never after recovered the shock
upon his nerves.</p>
<p>The bodies of the two mutineers were interred in Hove
churchyard, contiguous to the centre of the old north boundary
wall, where their remains continued undisturbed till the
restoration of the Church, in 1834, when a saw-pit was dug at the
actual spot, and a few of their bones were exhumed.&nbsp; The
burying party was under Sergeant-Major Masters, who afterwards
was a publican at Witney.&nbsp; The receipt for the burial fees
on the interment of the bodies is still retained by his
family.&nbsp; A few years since, Mr. Samuel Thorncroft, the
Assistant-Overseer of Brighton, being at Witney, by chance called
at Masters&rsquo;s house, when, the subject of the execution of
the two men being introduced, the receipt referred to was shown
him, and Masters stated that so infamously constructed were the
coffins in which the corpses were put that, notwithstanding they
were buried in their regimental attire, their blood oozed through
the coffins and ran down the backs of their comrades who conveyed
them to their grave.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Goldstone Bottom is memorable not only for
these military executions, but, also, for the hanging and
gibbeting of two men, James Rook and Edward Howell, on the 26th
of April, 1793, just north of the Old Shoreham road, beyond Hove
Drove.&nbsp; Their crime was robbing the mail, at that time
conveyed between Brighton and Shoreham by a lad, named John
Stephenson, on horseback.&nbsp; The robbery took place on the
night of the 30th of October, 1792.&nbsp; What they took was of
little value; and they used no violence.&nbsp; In a barn adjacent
they broke open the letters and shared their trifling
contents.</p>
<p>Their apprehension was effected by an old woman, named
Ph&oelig;be Hassell, who happened, as was her frequent custom, to
be taking some refreshment at the Red Lion public house, at Old
Shoreham, kept at that time by a man named Penton, when Rook came
in and ordered some beer.&nbsp; In the course of conversation
with <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>the
persons present, the subject of the mail robbery came up, and
from some observations made by Rook, Ph&oelig;be, in her own
mind, was convinced that he was one of the party in the
affair.&nbsp; She in consequence, went out and gave information
of what had transpired to the parish constable, Bartholomew
Roberts, who was well acquainted with Rook, then living with his
mother in a small cottage close by, on the spot now occupied by
Adur Lodge.&nbsp; On being taken into custody, Rook, whose age
was about 24, a simple, inoffensive fellow, who had been the dupe
of his companion in the crime, admitted the offence, and afforded
such intelligence as led to the apprehension of Howell, at Old
Shoreham mill, where, at the time, he was reading a pamplet to
the miller.&nbsp; Howell was 40 years old, and by trade a
tailor.</p>
<p>Some of the stolen property was found upon them; and their
identification by the mail-boy being complete, they were
committed from the Fountain Inn, for trial at the Spring Assizes,
at Horsham, when, being found guilty, they were sentenced to be
executed at the spot where the robbery had been effected.&nbsp;
They were conveyed to Horsham on horseback, and for their safe
custody, not only were they handcuffed, and pinioned with strong
cords, but each had his legs roped together under the
horse&rsquo;s belly, and, besides the constable that accompanied
them, there was a military escort of four cavalry.</p>
<p>An immense concourse of spectators witnessed the execution of
these unfortunate men, whose bodies, according to the barbarous
custom of the times, were afterwards encased in an iron skeleton
dress and gibbetted.&nbsp; The disgusting sight of their decaying
bodies remained some time a terror to the timid, but a mark of
recreation to the reckless and thoughtless, who were accustomed
to throw at them and practise many revolting tricks.</p>
<p>Many relics of the event remain in the possession of
inhabitants of Shoreham and Hove; Mr. Alderman Martin, in
Brighton, has, at the present time, a tobacco stopper which was
made from the bone of a finger of Rook.</p>
<p>When, however, the elements had caused the clothes and the
flesh to decay, the aged mother of Rook, night after night, in
all weathers,&mdash;and the more tempestuous the weather the more
frequent <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>the visits,&mdash;made a sacred pilgrimage to the
lonely spot; and it was noticed that on her return she always
brought something away in her apron.&nbsp; Upon being watched, it
was discovered that the bones of the hanging men were the objects
of her search, and as the wind and rain scattered them on the
ground she collected the relics, and conveyed them to her home,
and when the gibbets were stripped of their horrid burthen, in
the dead silence of the night she interred them, deposited in a
chest, in the hallowed ground of Old Shoreham Churchyard.</p>
<p>Besides being found guilty of robbing the mail, the Grand
Jury, at the same Assizes, returned a &ldquo;True Bill&rdquo;
against James Rook, for horse stealing; but he was not put upon
his trial for that offence, in consequence of being left for
death upon the other charge.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Brief&rdquo; for
the prosecution in the horse stealing case, now
&ldquo;held&rdquo; by the author of this book, runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

Penfold, now Messrs. Penfold and Son, solicitors.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be Hassell, the person who was chiefly instrumental
in bringing Rook and Howell to justice, was a very celebrated
character.&nbsp; She was born at Stepney, London, in March, 1713,
of respectable parents, named Smith.&nbsp; Of her early life
little is known; but the first incident of her remarkable career,
as related <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>by herself to the compiler of this work, was her
falling in love with Samuel Golding, a private in the regiment
known as Kirke&rsquo;s Lambs.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be Smith then was
but fifteen years of age, being, as she used to remark, a fine
lass for her years.&nbsp; Golding&rsquo;s regiment being ordered
to the West Indies in 1728, such was Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
attachment for him, that, donning the garb of a man, she enlisted
into the 5th regiment of Foot, commanded by General Pearce, then
under orders, also for the West Indies, and embarked after
him.&nbsp; There she served for five years without discovering
herself to any one.&nbsp; She was likewise at Monserrat, and
would have been in the action there, but her regiment did not
reach the island till after the battle was over.&nbsp; Soon after
her return to England her regiment was ordered to join the forces
under the Duke of Cumberland, on the continent, and she was
present at the battle of Fontenoy, May 1st, 1745, when she
received a bayonet wound in her arm.&nbsp; Golding&rsquo;s and
her regiment were afterwards at Gibraltar, where he got wounded,
and was then invalided home to Plymouth.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be then
informed the Lady of General Pearce of her sex and story,
obtained her discharge, and was immediately sent to
England.&nbsp; She went to the military hospital at Plymouth,
with letters of recommendation from her late Colonel, and there
nursed Golding; and when he came out of the hospital they were
married, and lived happily together for more than 20 years.&nbsp;
Golding had a pension from Chelsea.</p>
<p>After but a short widowhood, she married William Hassell, of
whom little is known beyond what is recorded in the parish book
of Brighton; extracts from which will show that in 1792 they were
in poverty, as at a meeting of the Churchwardens and Overseers,
held at the Castle Tavern, on the 5th of December that year, it
was:&mdash;&ldquo;Ordered that Ph&oelig;be, the wife of William
Hassell, be paid three guineas to get their bed and netts, which
they had pledged to pay Dr. Henderson for medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hassell died about this period, and Ph&oelig;be then, by the
assistance of a few of the inhabitants, purchased a donkey, and
travelled with fish and other commodities to the villages
westward; and it was on one of these journeys that she obtained
the capture of Rook and Howell for robbing the mail.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>The
following minute appears in the Vestry book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1797.&mdash;20th May, at a meeting of the
Churchwardens and Overseers held at the Hen and Chickens, (now
the Running Horse, King Street)&mdash;Ordered, that Ph&oelig;be
Hassell&rsquo;s rent be paid from the present time, and that her
weekly allowance be discontinued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early part of the present century the infirmities of
age began to tell upon her, and, being no longer able to get
about the country, she was taken into Brighton Workhouse; from
which, however, at her own request, she was discharged in August,
1806, as a minute of the vestry held on the 14th of that month
states:&mdash;&ldquo;That Ph&oelig;be Hassell be allowed a pair
of stockings and one change on leaving the poor-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this period she obtained a subsistence by selling fruit,
bulls-eyes, pin-cushions, &amp;c., at the bottom of the Marine
Parade, near Old Steine Street, where, in sunny weather, she used
to sit in a chair with her basket of wares beside her, and
obtained a good amount of custom.&nbsp; Her costume would, at the
present day, form a great attraction.&nbsp; She wore a brown
serge dress, a white apron,&mdash;always clean,&mdash;a black
cloth cloak with a hood, surmounted by a red spotted with white
handkerchief.&nbsp; Her head-dress was a black antique shaped
bonnet over a mob cap.&nbsp; Her shoes were for service and not
look, without any regard to &ldquo;rights and lefts;&rdquo; and
her hands and arms were usually encased in a pair of long woollen
mittens.&nbsp; Her walking-stick, now in the possession of Mr.
Edward Blaker, of Portslade, was a serviceable piece of oak.</p>
<p>Hone, in The Year Book, date, Sept. 22, 1821, says, &ldquo;I
saw this woman to-day in her bed, to which she is confined from
having lost the use of her limbs.&nbsp; She has even now, old and
withered as she is, a fine character of countenance, and I should
judge, from her present appearance, must have had a fine though
perhaps masculine style of head when young.&nbsp; I have seen
many a woman, at the age of sixty or seventy look older than she
does under the load of 106 years of human life.&nbsp; Her checks
are round, and seem firm, though ploughed with many a small
wrinkle.&nbsp; Her eyes, though the sight is gone, are large and
well formed.&nbsp; As soon as it was announced that somebody had
come to see her, she broke the silence of her solitary thoughts
and spoke.&nbsp; She began in a complaining tone, as if <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the remains
of a strong and restless spirit were impatient of the prison of a
decaying and weak body.&nbsp; &lsquo;Other people die and I
cannot,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; Upon exciting the recollection of
her former days, her energy seemed roused, and she spoke with
emphasis.&nbsp; Her voice was strong for an old person, and I
could easily believe her when, upon being asked if her sex was
not in danger of being discovered by her voice, she replied that
she always had a strong and manly voice.&nbsp; She appeared to
take a pride in having kept her secret, declaring that she told
it to no man, woman, or child, during the time she was in the
army; &lsquo;for you know, Sir, a drunken man and a child always
tell the truth.&nbsp; But I told my secret to the ground.&nbsp; I
dug a hole that would hold a gallon, and whispered it
there.&rsquo;&nbsp; While I was with her the flies annoyed her
extremely: she drove them away with a fan, and said they seemed
to smell her out as one that was going to the grave.&nbsp; She
showed me a wound she had received in her elbow by a
bayonet.&nbsp; She lamented the error of her former ways, but
excused it by saying, &lsquo;when you are at Rome, you must do as
Rome does.&rsquo;&nbsp; When she could not distinctly hear what
was said, she raised herself in the bed and thrust her head
forward with impatient energy.&nbsp; She said, when the King,
George IV,&mdash;saw her, he called her &lsquo;a jolly old
fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Though blind, she could discern a glimmering
light, and I was told would frequently state the time of day by
the effect of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had nine children, but none of them attained any
age except the eldest son, who was a sailor, but she had neither
seen nor heard of him for many years prior to her decease.</p>
<p>On the 12th of August, 1814, at the festival which took place
at the Royal Cricket Ground, to commemorate the peace on Napoleon
Buonaparte retiring to Elba, Ph&oelig;be, as the &ldquo;Oldest
Inhabitant,&rdquo; sat on the left of the Vicar, the Rev. Robert
Carr, and was an interesting object, then 99 years of age, and
many presents in silver and one pound notes found their way to
her from the opulent and enquiring part of the crowd.&nbsp; On
the celebration of the Coronation of George IV., Ph&oelig;be, at
the age of 107, and totally blind, took part in the ceremonies,
and was present on the Level in a carriage with the Rev. B. Carr,
(Vicar), and cheerfully joined in the National Anthem.&nbsp; This
incident brought her into great notoriety; <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>and several
ladies being struck with her appearance, and pleased with the
respectable character she bore, raised a subscription, each
subscriber being presented with Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s likeness,
beneath which was inscribed, &ldquo;An Industrious Woman living
at Brighton, with very slender means of Support, which she can
only earn by selling the contents of her basket, for whose
assistance this Etching is sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some few years previous to her decease, which took place
on the 12th of December, 1821, she was allowed half-a-guinea
a-week by the King.&nbsp; It is related that His Majesty offered
her a guinea a-week, but she refused it, saying that half that
sum was enough to maintain her.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, in support of a good old Sussex custom,
regularly, on St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day, 21st of December, went out
&ldquo;Gooding,&rdquo; visiting well-to-do parishioners, to
gossip upon the past, over hot elderberry wine and plum cake, and
to receive doles, either in money or materials, to furnish home
comforts for the celebration of the festivities of
Christmas.&nbsp; One of her places of call was the residence of
Mr. Robert Ackerson, where the author of this book has many a
time and oft heard the old female warrior tell of her deeds of
arms.&nbsp; She made a prediction that the wife of Mr. Ackerson
would live to a good old age; and so it came to pass, as, on
Friday, the 2nd of February, 1855, she expired, being then in her
97th year. <a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181"
class="citation">[181]</a>&nbsp; On the St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day
previous to her decease, <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>not one of her pensioners, as she
termed them, paid her a visit, they having all died off, gone as
she said, after Old Ph&oelig;be, and she felt assured that she
then should soon follow.</p>
<p>Mr. Hyam Lewis, father of Mr. Benjamin Lewis, silversmith and
jeweller, Ship Street, erected the tombstone in the Old
Churchyard, which marks the spot where the remains of Ph&oelig;be
are deposited.</p>

THE STEINE AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.</h2>
<p>No part of Brighton has undergone so many changes during the
last century as the Steine, which was at first the drying-ground
for fishermen&rsquo;s nets and the &ldquo;laying-up&rdquo; place
for such boats as were not in use at particular fishing seasons
of the year.&nbsp; The term Steine is of Flemish origin, and is
derived from <i>Ein</i>, <i>Stein</i>, or <i>Steen</i>, a rock,
as at the time when the town received its Flemish colony, the
southern extremity of the valley in which Brighton lay was edged
and protected from the sea by a ledge of chalk rocks, and from
these the name Steine, or rocky, was given to the field or
meadow, which was called the Steine Field.&nbsp; The word is
generally, but erroneously written Steine, in <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>conformity
with the old corrupt spelling of the Normans and Normanized
English in this country.&nbsp; &ldquo;The final <i>e</i>,&rdquo;
says Paul Dunvan, &ldquo;which our ancestors borrowed from the
French language, was apposite to the genius and usage of the
Saxon and Teutonic: and in the modern English language, the use
of it is admissible in words of Saxon origin, only to denote the
elongation of the preceding vowel, or the liquidity of the letter
<i>g</i>.&nbsp; The obvious power, therefore, of the dipthong
<i>ei</i> makes the attendance of this Norman lackey after the
Teutonic noun, Stein, or Steen, totally unnecessary.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The addition of the final <i>e</i> is a modern innovation, as on
the Court Rolls of a Court Baron, held for the Manor of
Brighthelmston-Lewes, is the following entry:&mdash;&ldquo;March
(27 Elizabeth) it is ordered, that no hog go unringed on the
Stein, where nets lie, under a penalty of eight-pence <i>toties
quoties</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1779, according to a map of that date, the only building on
the east side of the Steine, was Thomas&rsquo;s Library; just to
the north-west of which, on the grass, was a slight erection much
after the style of the judge&rsquo;s stand at races.&nbsp; This
structure was the orchestra, in which the town band, of three
performers, discoursed their music under their leader, Mr.
Anthony Crook, whose instrument was the trombone.&nbsp; The side
of the hill whereon St. James&rsquo;s Street, Edward Street, and
the numerous streets which swell the town to the east and
north-east now stand, was, &ldquo;a delightful and rich tract of
down, arable and pasture:&rdquo; and in an old print of
Brighthelmston, in 1765, reapers are represented employed in
cutting and teams of oxen in carrying the crops on the ground now
occupied by the Marine Parade, Grand Parade, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Thomas&rsquo;s Library was the building now modernized and in the
occupation of the Electric Telegraph Company.&nbsp; The Steine at
that period was of much larger dimensions than at present.&nbsp;
In Godwin&rsquo;s rental mention is made of &ldquo;the common
pound of Brighthelston manor, together with a cottage and garden
adjoining the said pound, situate on the Steine on the west side
of East Street;&rdquo; and in the same rental a bowling-green on
the Steine is occasionally mentioned.</p>
<p>In tempestuous weather and during the winter, the boats of the
fishermen were hauled up for safety on the Steine.&nbsp; A
Diarist, dating his memorandum, Wednesday, September 8th, 1778,
says, <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;An old well is half open among the boats; a
little child has just now waddled off the Steyne towards
it.&nbsp; I ran to prevent mischief, and succeeded.&mdash;Have
remonstrated against this dangerous neglect in vain.&nbsp; There
are one dry and two wet wells open thereabouts.&nbsp; When a
child of fortune or two shall have been lost therein, the wells
may be boarded over.&mdash;The Commissioners by the Act have
sufficient powers, and collect money enough to answer its
purposes; yet the Cliff-side is all along covered with rubbish,
offensive to the sight and smell.&nbsp; Indeed, there is no
occasion to search much for nuisances, obstructions, and
inconveniences, in this place.&mdash;<i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Since the
above complaint, some loose boards have been laid across one of
the wet wells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the time of Elizabeth, and even at a more recent date, the
inhabitants were wholly supplied with water from the public
wells, which were town property, under the control of the Lords
of the different Manors.&nbsp; Thus, at a Court Baron held for
the Manor of Brighthelmston-Lewes, in October (20 Elizabeth) a
bye-law was made that nothing should be laid within four feet of
any well within the said Manor.&nbsp; On the Court Rolls, also,
of the same Manor, appears the following:&mdash;&ldquo;April (19
Jac.) it is ordered at the Court-Leet, that a building which
Richard Scrase, gentleman, has erected over the common well in
the upper end of North Street, shall not convey to the said
Scrase, or his heirs, any right in the said well, more than as an
inhabitant.&rdquo;&nbsp; This well remained in use till within
the last few years, and was known as the Unicorn Yard well, and
was situate in the present space immediately in front of
Blaber&rsquo;s eating-house, at the south end of Windsor
Street.&nbsp; Another well was in West Street, in the water
channel before the premises now occupied by Mr. Feldwick, cabinet
maker.&nbsp; The curb of it was raised, on a brick-work platform,
around which was the main watercourse of the street.&nbsp; About
eighty years ago, in consequence of the well becoming an
impediment to the increased traffic in the street, and being but
little used, it was domed over, and for some years a square stone
at the edge of the pavement marked its site.&nbsp; The other town
wells still in use by means of pumps, are on the Knab; in East
Street, by the Sussex Arms, formerly the Spread Eagle; in Market
Street, opposite Payne&rsquo;s Hotel; and in Pool <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Valley,
adjoining the Duke of Wellington Inn.&nbsp; The well situate just
without the poultry portion of the Market, and likewise the one
in Little East Street, from being put out of use by the service
of the Water Company, have been closed over, as has also the
great northern well which but a few years since supplied a large
tank that was erected on the area between St. Peter&rsquo;s
Church Enclosure and the Level, for the street watering
service.&nbsp; The remaining town wells and their pumping gear,
now out of use, are situate, one at the Grafton Street Police
Station, and the other under the roadway at the entrance to the
Pier Esplanade, at the bottom of the Steine.&nbsp; The pump of
the last mentioned well, about forty years since, was worked by a
donkey, which traversed, &ldquo;on the getting up stairs&rdquo;
principle, the interior of a wheel that was fitted to the
groyne.&nbsp; On a brisk March day, however, when the wind was
blowing up more of the dust of that month than is proverbially
required to be equal in worth with a king&rsquo;s ransom, while
the machinery was working under the influence of the usual
propelling power, Old Father Neptune, as if envious of the poor
animal&rsquo;s dominion over the aqueous element, mounted a
foaming billow and rushed into the wheel after the donkey.&nbsp;
Neddy&rsquo;s good genius, who was in constant attendance upon
him,&mdash;just to sharpen his appetite for work when he felt
disposed for a rest,&mdash;luckily superseded the design of the
mythological sovereign of the deep, by whipping-out his quadruped
friend, before the turbulent king could lash around him.&nbsp;
This increased the rage of Neptune, who, on retiring to his deep
abode, bodily tore away the wheel and its fixings.</p>
<p>Previous to the supply from the town pumps, the water for the
streets was obtained from the sea.&nbsp; The water carts then
were of the most primitive description, and consisted of barrels
on wheels, similar to those now in use for the conveyance of
water upon farms.&nbsp; But they had in addition, fixed at the
backs of them, an oblong perforated box each, for the
distribution of the water, which was supplied from the barrels by
pulling out plugs of wood that projected into the boxes.&nbsp;
The barrels were filled by backing them some distance into the
sea, when the water was lifted into funnels fitted to the bung
holes, by a species of scoop at the end of a pole, the operator
of this intelligent process the while, standing on the <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>shafts of
the carts, or Bacchus like, and hare-legged, bestriding the
barrels.</p>
<p>The Steine then was entirely open, and was a country walk for
visitors.&nbsp; That is to say, in the Spring, Summer, and
Autumn; as in Winter time, from its then lying very hollow, the
southern part was generally flooded, and in severe weather the
sheet of ice which was there formed was a general rendezvous for
sliding and skating.&nbsp; When fashion made the Steine a place
of public resort, attention was paid by the town authorities, to
make it in some degree, attractive.&nbsp; The ground was made
level, and verdure was encouraged to ornament it.&nbsp; On it the
old Duke of Cumberland, of Fontenoy, delighted to turn out the
stag and hunt the bounding deer, as the place was entirely open
to the full extent of the Downs; and the inhabitants were
gratified with repeated spectacles of the kind, sometimes as
often as twice or thrice in a season.</p>
<p>Sports of a less aristocratic character sometimes took place
here, as the following extract from the <i>Morning Herald</i>
will verify:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1805, September 11th.&mdash;A pony race on the
Level, this morning afforded much diversion to a very numerous
assemblage of spectators.&nbsp; After this, donkey races took
place: seven started for the first heat, and what is very
singular, two, on this starting, ran a <i>dead heat</i>; a
circumstance, probably, with quadrupeds of this sluggish tribe,
never recorded in the annals of sporting.&nbsp; The donkies
having performed their task, the company removed to the Steyne,
to the South, where <i>jumping in sacks</i>, and a jingling match
kept hilarity alive for about two hours longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were Jenkinses of the Press even at this period, who
watched with keen eye the doings of royalty, and of the nobility,
as will be seen by the following extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Morning Herald</i>, August 9, 1805.&mdash;This
morning, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex honoured the
Steyne Promenade with their presence, and for a short time before
dinner, rode on horseback.&nbsp; Mr. Mellish drove Lord
Barrymore&rsquo;s curricle two or three times round the Steyne,
this morning.&nbsp; The quartern loaf here, now sells for one
shilling and six pence.</p>
<p>August 19th.&mdash;The Duke of Sussex rode out in an open
barouche and amused himself in smoking a pipe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following are also extracts from a private diary kept in
1805:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>August 4th.&mdash;The Cliff Parade, from the South
end of the Steine to the unfinished Crescent, displayed much
genteel company this afternoon.&nbsp; The Cyprian Corps have much
increased in number within the last two or three days.&nbsp; We
have now <i>little French Milliners</i> in every part of the
town.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>August 27th.&mdash;Townshend and Sayers, two Bow Street
officers, arrived here this morning, in quest of an individual
who has been guilty of a burglary in the metropolis.&nbsp; They
had been here but a short time when the object they were in
search of, in a laced livery, was descried by them in the act of
crossing the Steine.&nbsp; They took him into custody, and having
ornamented his wrists with a pair of iron ruffles, they bore him
off in triumph to London.</p>
<p>September 19th.&mdash;About half-past one o&rsquo;clock the
Prince of Wales returned from a walk to the west of the Steine,
to the Pavilion.&nbsp; His Royal Highness, who was habited in a
black coat and waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, appeared rather
lame from the recent hurt he had received in his ankle.&nbsp; He
walked with a stick, of sufficient dimensions occasionally to
bear his weight.</p>
<p>September 26th.&mdash;The Duke of Clarence was to-day, for a
short time, on the Steine.&nbsp; Some of His Highness&rsquo;s
sons are at this time here, and were under the military
instructions of a sergeant of the South Gloucester Militia this
morning on the Pavilion lawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steine was first partially enclosed with common hurdles;
then it was partly paved and railed in.&nbsp; At last the present
massive iron railings were erected.&nbsp; But not as they at
present stand.&nbsp; They surrounded a much larger area, and the
lamp-posts were the main standards, the rails being fastened in
them.&nbsp; At that period the paving around the Steine, under
the then Town Surveyor, Mr. Thomas Harman, was considered a
masterpiece of the art of paving in brick.&nbsp; Previous to this
improvement, there was no carriage road completely round the
Steine, vehicles of every description, from Castle Square to
Prince&rsquo;s Street, having to pass down the west of the Steine
and Pool Valley, along at the back of the York Hotel, up the east
of the Steine, and by way of the back of (now) the Telegraph
Office, down St. James&rsquo;s Street, and then along by the
eastern side of the north Steine, as posts erected across from
the Castle Tavern to the Steine railings admitted only of
foot-traffic, and the coaches for London and Lewes went from
Castle Square by way of North Street, New Road, Church Street,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The road across from Castle Square to St.
James&rsquo;s Street was effected on Easter Monday, March 31st,
1834, and appeared to be a work of magic, as the long-desired
improvement had met with opposition from parties who feared the
alteration would affect their interest in property from which the
traffic would be diverted.&nbsp; The resolution was passed by the
Commissioners, and on the day above-mentioned, the
&ldquo;trick&rdquo; was done, although the opposition hastened to
town to procure an injunction <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>from the Lord Chancellor; as it so
happened, that it was the Easter vacation, so his Lordship could
not he approached till all the alterations had been
performed.&nbsp; On the reinstating of the iron railings, the
lamp-posts were placed at the edge of the pavement, as hitherto,
half of the light from the lamps had been cast on the space
within the railings, where it was not required.&nbsp; The posts
still show the holes through which the iron railings passed when
they were in their original position.</p>
<p>The chief modern features on the Old Steine are the statue of
George IV., the Fountain, and the Russian guns.&nbsp; The first
was put up on the 11th of October, 1828.&nbsp; The idea of its
erection originated with a party of tradesmen, who were
accustomed to assemble nightly at the King&rsquo;s Arms, George
Street; but a subscription which remained open for more than
eight years and a half did not provide the sum, &pound;3,000,
agreed to be paid Chantry for his artistic skill.&nbsp; The
Fountain, known as the Victoria Fountain, was also erected by
subscription, procured through the indefatigable exertions of Mr.
Cordy Burrows, to whom also the credit is due for the planting of
the Steines with flowers and trees.&nbsp; The Fountain was
inaugurated on the 25th of May, 1846.&nbsp; The design of the
structure was furnished by Mr. Henry Wilds, the model of the
dolphins by Mr. William Pepper, and the ironwork was cast at the
Eagle Foundry.&nbsp; The rock-work upon which the dolphins rest
is formed of huge sand-stones, called in Wiltshire and Berkshire,
&ldquo;Grey Weathers,&rdquo; and breccia, or pudding-stone, which
for lengthened periods had lain in Goldstone Bottom, on the Dyke
Road, and fields adjacent, by many persons considered to be the
remains of Druidical temples or altars.&nbsp; But such a notion
must be fallacious, as, at a very recent date, similar
accumulations of sand-stone have been dug up about the western
part of Brighton, where the soil exhibits many irregularities
which geologists are unable to account for.&nbsp; An instance of
this occurred in digging out the ground for the foundation of the
tower of All Saints&rsquo; Church, Buckingham Place, the soil to
a considerable depth at one particular spot, being so loose and
treacherous that great ingenuity and care had to be
observed&mdash;attended with great expense,&mdash;by Messrs.
Cheesman and Son, the builders, to make the foundation
secure.&nbsp; <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>A stone also, of the character termed Druidical
<i>cromlech</i>, was dug out while preparing for the foundation
of the present Brighton Workhouse, and was used for the corner
stone of the building.&nbsp; In excavating the ground likewise,
in 1823, for laying in the gas-pipes across the Steine, from
Castle Square to the corner of the Marine Parade, huge unshapen
blocks of a like character were turned up.&nbsp; The last memento
on the Steine, the Russian guns, are relics of the siege of
Sebastopol.</p>
<p>The old maps shew a piece of water on the Steine, between the
Castle Tavern and the Pavilion, formed by the spring which rose
at Patcham and used to flow by the Pool&mdash;Pool Valley.&nbsp;
In the year 1793, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of
Marlborough, whose house stood at the north end of the Marine
Pavilion, made an arched sewer along the Steine, to carry away
this water into the sea, and, in consideration of the expense and
improvement, the Lords of the Manor, with consent of the homage,
gave his Royal Highness and the Duke permission to rail in or
enclose a certain portion of the Steine, adjoining their houses
respectively, but never to build on or encumber it with any thing
that might obstruct the prospect, or in any other way be a
nuisance to the Steine.&nbsp; A barn which stood at this spot,
the property of Mr. Howell, as shewn in the view of the Steine,
1765, was moved, at the request of the Prince of Wales, to the
top of Church Street, into the field whereon also stood the
Infantry Barracks Hospital, a wooden building that occupied the
site of the Hanover Chapel Burial Ground.&nbsp; There were two
main entrances to the sewer.&nbsp; One was about the centre of
the road,&mdash;along which the water channel ran,&mdash;opposite
the Pavilion Parade; and the other was in the roadway immediately
to the east of the entrance to Castle Square from the
Steine.&nbsp; Each was protected by a wooden railing in a
triangular form.&nbsp; The sewer discharged itself by means of a
square wooden trunk at the back of Williams&rsquo;s Baths, now
the south front of the Lion Mansion.</p>
<p>In 1785&ndash;6, the first houses on the South Parade, the
east side of the Steine south of St. James&rsquo;s Street, began
to be erected, and in a few years the whole of them, as well as
the extensive range of buildings which forms the North Parade,
were completed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fitzherbert&rsquo;s mansion, now the residence of W.
Furner, <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Esq., the Judge of the County Court of this district,
adjoining the present mansion of Captain Thellusson, was built in
1804.&nbsp; On the site now occupied by the square block of
buildings that form the north-east corner of Castle Square, about
forty years since, stood the Castle Tavern, which had been one of
the chief rendezvous of royalty, the nobility, and the
gentry.&nbsp; It was originally a very small house, but being
considered the best in the town for a tavern, it was purchased by
Mr. Shergold, who opened it under the sign of the Castle, in
1755.&nbsp; Such was its success, in consequence of the increase
of visitors to the town, that, in 1776, Messrs. Tilt and Best
joined him in partnership, and the premises were greatly
extended.&nbsp; In 1790, the other parties having given up the
business, Mr. Tilt carried on the undertaking, and he was
succeeded by his widow.&nbsp; In 1814, Messrs. Gilburd and
Harryett became the proprietors.&nbsp; It attained the acme of
its celebrity when in the hands of Mr. Tilt, who attached to the
establishment an elegant suite of Assembly and Concert Rooms,
built with great taste and judgment by Mr. Crunden, of Park
Street, London, in 1776.&nbsp; The Ball Room was rectangular, 80
feet by 40 feet, with recesses at each end and side, 16 feet by 4
feet, decorated with columns corresponding with the pilasters
which were continued round the room, dividing the sides and ends
into a variety of compartments, ornamented with paintings from
the Admirander and the Vatican, representing a portion of the
story of Cupid and Psyche, and the Aldrobrandini marriage; with
air-nymphs and divers other figures, in the ancient grotesque
style.&nbsp; The ceiling was curved, and formed an arch of one
fifth of the height of the room, which was 35 feet.&nbsp; Over
the entablature, at each end of the room, was a large painting;
the one a representation of Aurora, and the other a figure of
Nox.&nbsp; In 1814, a beautifully toned organ by Flight and
Robson was erected at the north end of the room.</p>
<p>In the season, from August to March, Assemblies were held
every Monday.&nbsp; These were under the management of Masters of
the Ceremonies, the first of whom were, in 1805, Mr. Yart at the
Old Ship, and Mr. William Wade at the Castle.&nbsp; They were
succeeded by Mr. J. S. Forth, in 1808.&nbsp; He acted in the same
capacity at the Old Ship and the Castle Assemblies.&nbsp;
Lieut.-Col. <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>Eld succeeded Mr. Forth, and at his decease, December
22nd, 1855, the office fell into disuse; in fact, for some years
previous to the decease of the Colonel his services were rarely
required, the progress of the age having rendered such an office
null and void.&nbsp; The duties of the Masters of the Ceremonies
consisted in watching minutely the arrival of the nobility and
gentry.&nbsp; For this purpose he attended the Libraries and
Hotels regularly once or more a-day to copy the lists of the
latest visitors, at whose addresses he then called and left his
card, a hint that they should enter their names in his book,
which lay at the principal places of fashionable resort, and with
each entry deposit a guinea with the custodian of the
M.C.&rsquo;s book, who received a per centage for his trouble and
attention.&nbsp; The payment of the fee ensured a mutual
recognition upon all occasions of meeting between the giver and
the receiver during that visit of the donor at Brighton, and, on
the occasions of balls and assemblies, he was expected to make
all the necessary arrangements, and for dances provide all
unprovided ladies and gentlemen with partners.&nbsp; Masters of
the Ceremonies originated at a period when balls and routs
terminated at ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t go home till morning,&rdquo; had not come into vogue,
but the sedan chair of &ldquo;my lady&rdquo; was in punctual
attendance, and the fair burden was wafted home to admit of
repose before midnight, and to give the sterner sex an
opportunity for a carouse or a spree.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from a private
diary:&mdash;&ldquo;July 30th, 1805.&nbsp; This evening, at nine
o&rsquo;clock, the first assembly of the season, the Grand Rose
Ball, was held at the Castle Inn, under the patronage of the
Prince of Wales.&nbsp; The Ball Room is large, lofty, and noble,
and commands a full view of the Steyne; looks, also, into the
Pavilion Gardens, the beautiful shrubberies of which are worthy
of the Royal resident.&nbsp; The ceiling forms an arch, and is
painted to represent the rising sun.&nbsp; Every part of the room
is ornamented with various masterly paintings of classical
antiquity.&nbsp; It was lighted up in a superior style, suited to
the dignity of the guests, with three cut-glass chandeliers, 100
lights, and forty lustres and side-lights.&nbsp; The Prince
entered the room at half-past nine, and at ten o&rsquo;clock the
Ball opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>During the erection of the Royal Stables, in Church
Street, in 1809, a carpenter, who lived in Jew Street, named John
Butcher, uncle to Mr. Butcher, of the present firm, Messrs.
Cheesman and Butcher, chinamen, North Street, accidentally fell
and injured himself.&nbsp; Upon his recovery, not being able to
resume the heavy work of his trade, he constructed a machine of a
similar make to the sedan chair, and placed it upon four
wheels.&nbsp; It was drawn by hand, in the same manner as Bath
chairs, while an assistant, when the person being conveyed was
heavy, pushed behind.&nbsp; Its introduction was quite a
favourite feature amongst the nobility, and a second fly, in
consequence, was soon constructed.&nbsp; These two vehicles were
extensively patronized by the Prince of Wales and his noble
companions; and from being employed by them on special occasions
of a midnight &ldquo;lark,&rdquo; they received the name of
&ldquo;Fly-by-nights,&rdquo; and soon entirely superseded
sedan-chairs, except for invalids on their conveyance to and from
the Baths.&nbsp; Butcher, from the great success which attended
his project, being desirous that his flys should have a more
elegant appearance than his ability in the ornamental could
effect, sent one of them, for the purpose of being repainted and
varnished, to Mr. Blaker, coach-maker, Regent Street, and he,
having an eye to business, purloined the design, and improved
upon it by making two or three to be drawn by horses.&nbsp; The
most remarkable vehicle of this description, for the conveyance
of one passenger only, was that made for Mr. George Battcock,
surgeon, who died on the 3rd of February last.&nbsp; It was
called Dr. Battcock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pill Box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When George IV. expressed a desire of converting the Castle
Assembly Room into a Chapel to be attached to the Royal Pavilion,
the fee simple of it was transferred to his Majesty, and as a
tavern attached to a place of divine worship would be a great
incongruity, the transfer of the license of the Castle was made
to premises in Steine Place, the Royal York Hotel, so designated
in reference to the Royal Duke, Frederick, whose permission for
the name was applied for and obtained from his Royal
Highness.&nbsp; The house was opened by Mr. Sheppard.</p>
<p>The Royal Albion Hotel, which has so conspicuous a position to
the south of the Steine, occupies the spot whereon formerly stood
<a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Russell
House, once the residence of Dr. Russell, and afterwards of the
Duke of Cumberland.&nbsp; In 1805, it was the residence of Miss
Johnson.&nbsp; It stood abruptly to the sea, the waves in stormy
weather laving the brick boundary wall to the south.&nbsp;
Immediately under its east wall was Haines&rsquo;s Repository for
toys, where, too, was also an apartment in which were exhibited
the wonders of the Camera Obscura.&nbsp; The Junction Road now
occupies the site; it was a favourite lounge with visitors.&nbsp;
The latter years of Russell House were of a remarkable character,
some portion of it being devoted by its owner, Mr. John Colbatch,
to copper-plate printing; while in the largest apartment the
wonders of Khia Khan Khruse, the chief of the Indian Jugglers,
were exhibited, in the Autumn of 1822.&nbsp; The building
eventually had a most neglected appearance, and was pulled
down.&nbsp; The purchase of the space then was contemplated by
the town, in order to keep open the southern extremity of the
Steine to the sea.&nbsp; Mr. Colbatch required &pound;6,000 for
it, a sum which the Town Commissioners assented to give; but
after numerous delays the bargain was off, and soon the present
noble building rose to shut out the southern aspect from the
Steine.</p>
<p>In 1792, during the Revolution which deluged France in its own
blood, there was a great influx of refugees from Dieppe to
Brighton, to escape the savage and unrelenting fury of their
persecutors.&nbsp; On the 29th of August, that year, the
Marchioness of Beaule landed at the bottom of the Steine, having
paid two hundred guineas at Dieppe, for her passage across, and
even then she was under the necessity of appearing in the dress
of a sailor, and as such she assisted the crew during the whole
voyage, not only to disguise herself, but in order to bring with
her, undiscovered, a favourite female, whom she conveyed on board
in a trunk, in which holes were bored to give her air.&nbsp; His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, with Mrs. Fitzherbert and
Miss Isabella Pigot, received them on landing, and the Prince
escorted them to the Earl of Clermont&rsquo;s, where tea was
provided for His Royal Highness and twenty of his friends.&nbsp;
On the 20th of September, two packets landed several persons of
distinction, amongst whom were the Archbishop of Aix, and Count
Bridges, one of the household of the hapless Louis XVI.&nbsp;
Many priests were amongst the refugees, <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>for the
relief of whom subscriptions to a considerable amount were made,
for the purpose of relieving their immediate necessities, and to
enable them to pursue their journey to London.&nbsp; On
Wednesday, October 20th, thirty-seven nuns, in the habit of their
order, were landed near Shoreham from the Prince of Wales packet,
commanded by Captain Burton.&nbsp; Their destination was
Brussels, where a convent was being prepared for them.&nbsp; It
had been intended that they should disembark at Brighton, but the
roughness of the sea prevented it.&nbsp; Captain Burton&rsquo;s
daughter was married to Mr. William Wigney, a north countryman,
who had then recently settled in Brighton, in North Street, where
he kept a linen-draper&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; The house,&mdash;which
he purchased of Lord Leslie, afterwards Lord Rother, who married
Henrietta Ann, daughter of the first Earl of Chichester,&mdash;he
paid for in French money, which he had received in exchange for
English coin from the refugees brought over by his
father-in-law.&nbsp; It is related of him that he was not over
scrupulous in the way of business, of passing half-franc pieces
for sixpences to the unwary.&nbsp; He was afterwards the head of
the firm of Messrs. Wigney, Rickman, and Co., bankers, Steine
Lane.</p>
<p>No part of Brighton has had a more varied character than the
Steine.&nbsp; From being the general depository of the materials
of the aborigines, for fishing, it became the place of rendezvous
for the nobility and gentry, the beaux and belles delighting to
promenade there, expend their small talk, and listen to the
strains of the military bands which daily played upon some
portion of it.&nbsp; Even upon Sunday afternoons, so recently as
twenty-three years since, the sounds of music attracted immense
crowds of the inhabitants and visitors there.&nbsp; Frequent
innovations, however, upon its space having taken place, and the
southern walks along the whole front of the town, having, by
their extension and commodiousness, become the fashionable
resort, the Steine has quieted down to a thoroughfare that
connects the east with the west portion of the town, and there is
a contentment that it shall remain an important lung of the
borough.</p>
<p>During the agitation for the Reform Bill, when self-esteemed
politicians tried their &rsquo;prentice voice upon stump oratory,
the Steine was the famous arena for their eloquence.&nbsp; Where
now, on gala <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>days, the triple rampant dolphins, which support on
their entwined tails the basins of the fountain, belave
themselves, a waggon has formed the vehicle for the conveyance of
political sentiments under the guise of Toryism, Whigism,
Chartism, or any other ism that the whim, rage, or fashion of the
day has chanced to assume.</p>
<p>The most memorable event on the Steine was the dinner given
there on the 3rd of September, 1830, to the children of the
various charity schools in the town, to commemorate the first
visit of William IV. and Queen Adelaide to Brighton.&nbsp; Their
Majesties arrived on the previous Monday, great preparations
having been made for their reception, triumphal arches and other
erections forming emblems of rejoicing throughout the space from
the extreme north of the town, on the London Road, to the
entrance of the Pavilion Grounds.&nbsp; Probably, now, when there
is so great a facility for the transmission of large masses of
people by means of the railway, the numbers of persons who came
into the town on the occasion, would be considered of little
moment; but then the quantity was estimated as vast, vehicles of
every description arriving in the town, heavily laden with human
beings, not only from all parts of the county, but even the
distance of two hundred miles was not considered too great to
travel in order to witness the imposing sight.&nbsp; For more
than a week prior to the appointed day, numbers of persons had
arrived in the town to ensure being present; and lodgings of
every description were seized with avidity, at&mdash;to use a
commercial term&mdash;long prices.&nbsp; The stage coaches from
London,&mdash;many of which were specially placed on the road to
meet the demands,&mdash;were crowded to excess at extra fares;
and the vans and spring waggons&mdash;as they were
termed&mdash;nightly bore heavy freights of provisions to meet
the anticipated rapid consumption.</p>
<p>Their Majesties arrived shortly after five o&rsquo;clock, and
were met by the High Constable, the Clergy, and a Committee of
the principal inhabitants, the children of the various schools
forming a line along the route through which the royal carriages
passed.&nbsp; The waving of handkerchiefs by the ladies from the
balconies, the shouts and huzzas of the people, the roaring of
cannon, the ringing of bells, the music of various bands, the
tramp <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>of
horses, the rattling of carriages, the floating of hundreds of
flags and banners, formed altogether a spectacle that had never
been previously, nor has it been since, equalled in
Brighton.&nbsp; The crowning feature of the day was a structure
in the form of a triumphal arch, which was of vast proportions,
fifty feet in height, the opening of the arch having a span of
twenty-five feet, and the whole was clothed with evergreens and
flowers.&nbsp; The top was covered with a profusion of flags and
streamers, from the Hyperion frigate, then stationed at Newhaven,
in the midst of which flaunted the Standard of England.&nbsp; A
body of sailors, belonging to the Coast Blockade service, dressed
in blue jackets and white trousers, were arranged pyramidically
on the top, and gave a crowning character to the spectacle, as
they gave three hearty cheers for the &ldquo;Sailor
King.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were seventy in number, supplied by
Captain Mingaye, of the Hyperion.&nbsp; The structure was crowded
with gaily dressed ladies, and the galleries of the archway were
filled with the girls of Swan Downer&rsquo;s Charity School, and
those of the National School, who at that time wore green dresses
and white mob caps.&nbsp; In the evening the town was one blaze
of light from a general illumination.</p>
<p>The preparations for dining the children were completed by
noon on Friday.&nbsp; Three rows of tables, with benches on each
side, were ranged round the whole area of the southern division
of the Steine, which at that time was one grass plot, to which
the spectators were admitted by tickets.&nbsp; The centre of the
lawn was left entirely open, no persons being allowed upon that
portion except the committee of management and the bands of the
Horse and Foot Guards.&nbsp; At the southern extremity of this
open space was a capacious marquee, erected for the accommodation
of their Majesties.&nbsp; The interior was laid out very
tastefully, and refreshments were prepared.&nbsp; At its entrance
waved the two large town flags, supported by two of the Committee
in blue sashes.&nbsp; Across the pavement between the two
divisions of the Steine a space was boarded off, as also, across
the northern division, and thence to the private entrance of the
Pavilion at the north end of the Steine.&nbsp; At this period
posts and rails skirted the outer edge of the pavement around the
whole of the Steine.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>The
spectators began to assemble on the pavement about one
o&rsquo;clock, at which time the whole circumference outside the
fence was belted with carriages, some of which had taken up their
position at an early hour in the morning.&nbsp; The parade of the
children to the grounds was a most pleasing sight, their general
cleanliness and their appearance of health and happiness,
imparting a most gratifying charm to the scene.&nbsp; By two
o&rsquo;clock the whole of the children were seated, and the
amphitheatre of the Steine, gradually rising from the children at
the tables to the spectators that girted them, and then on to the
carriages covered with persons, and beyond that the thousands
which crowded the windows, balconies, and the very roofs of the
houses that bound the Steine, afforded a spectacle far more
imposing than the most vivid imagination can conceive.</p>
<p>Precisely at two o&rsquo;clock, their Majesties, accompanied
by the Princess Augusta, the Landgravine of Hesse Homburgh, the
Duke of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge, Sir Augustus and
Lady D&rsquo;Este, and others, came across from the Pavilion
Grounds to the boarded-off avenue, where they were met by the
High Constable, who had received His Majesty&rsquo;s commands to
escort the royal party to the festive scene, where they received
the respects of the Magistrates, Clergy, and Gentry.&nbsp; Having
surveyed the scene for some time, their Majesties and suite
passed along the line close to the children, frequently returning
the salutations of the people with the utmost affability and
condescension.&nbsp; Having returned to the entrance, their
Majesty&rsquo;s bowed to the vast assemblage and withdrew,
attended by their royal relatives.&nbsp; At that moment the
regimental bands struck up the National Anthem, and shouts
simultaneously burst from every lip.&nbsp; Even the children,
whose eyes only, as yet, had been feasted, rose and mingled their
shrill voices with the harmony of throats.</p>
<p>It was calculated that more than 60,000 persons were present
to view the feeding of the youthful multitude, who, immediately
on the Grace having been said by the Rev. H. M.
Wagner&mdash;Vicar,&mdash;were supplied with an unlimited
quantity of roast and boiled beef and plum pudding by the
numerous carvers who had volunteered their services, lady
waitresses with the utmost alacrity attending <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>most
assiduously upon the youthful guests.&nbsp; It was an occasion
that formed an epoch in the life of every person present.&nbsp;
On the occasion of the first visit of Queen Victoria to Brighton,
October 4th, 1837, a similar banquet was given to the children
upon the Steine.</p>
<p>The most celebrated public buildings of the Steine were the
libraries, which were the principal resort of the visitors.&nbsp;
The first library here was instituted by Mr. Woodgate, at the
southern extremity, on the premises at present occupied by Mr.
Shaw, confectioner, and others, contiguous to the York Hotel,
where also was the Post Office.&nbsp; Mr. Woodgate was succeeded
by Miss Widget, who resigned it to Mr. Bowen; after whom came Mr.
Crawford, and, lastly, Mr. F. G. Fisher.</p>
<p>The other library was that of Mr. Thomas, after whom was Mr.
Dudlow, who was succeeded by Mr. James Gregory, whose successor,
Mr. Donaldson, resigned the establishment to Mr. Thomas
Lucombe.&nbsp; Mr. Donaldson pulled down the original low
building in 1806, and erected the present structure, which has
however, since the carriage road has been formed in front of it,
been much modernized to suit the various businesses to which the
premises have been devoted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Diarist,&rdquo; writing August 23rd, 1779, says,
&ldquo;There is a sort of rivalry between the two Librarians on
the Steyne, as to their subscription books; which shall most
justly deserve the title of the book of Numbers.&mdash;There is a
constant struggle between them, which shall be most courteous;
and the effects are those usually consequent upon an
opposition.&nbsp; Sir Christopher Caustic, this morning was
turning over the leaves, at Bowen&rsquo;s, which contains the
names of the subscribers.&nbsp; Mr. Bowen bowed <i>a la
Novarre</i> or <i>Gallini</i>, and with offered pen and ink,
craved the honour of&mdash;an additional name: this being his
first season, and having been purposely misinformed by some would
be witty wag; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Bowen, displaying, all
the time, two irregular rows of remarkably white teeth,
&lsquo;yours will stand immediately after that of the Honourable
Charles James Fox, Esq., and before that of Mrs. Franco, the rich
Jew&rsquo;s lady.&nbsp; Esquire W&mdash;d&rsquo;s was to have
been on the medium line, but, poor gentleman, he is unfortunately
<i>detained</i> near London, on <i>emergent</i>
business.&rsquo;&nbsp; To what a degree was the dealer in
stationery <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>let down, when he was afterwards regularly rectified;
when by explanatory notes, and critical commentations, he came to
be fully informed that the individual Mr. Fox in question was not
the celebrated senator of that name, but an Irish
<i>Jontleman</i>, who condescends in winter to keep a chop house
at the corner of the playhouse passage, in Bow Street, Covent
Garden; and every autumnal season, has frequent opportunities of
storming and swearing at the ladies who may have the good fortune
to belong to the Brighthelmstone company of Comedians, he being
sole manager thereof.&nbsp; And such
management!&mdash;<i>Scarrons Rancour</i>, who filled all the
characters in a play by himself, was a fool to him.&nbsp; That
Mrs. Franco was, to be sure, the temporary wife of young Mr.
Franco, last season, but seems at leisure this to be the
temporary wife of even Mr. Bowen, if he pleases; and that poor
Billy, who was the <i>Beau</i>, is confined, <i>custodia
marcellis</i>, <i>Banco Regis</i>, on suspicion of debt, where he
blacks shoes, cleans knives, and turns spits, for the privilege
of dipping sops in the dripping-pans of poor
prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thomas, the other librarian, must be noticed in
turn.&nbsp; He hath been years enough practising small talk with
the ladies and gentlemen upon the Steyne, and hath arrived at a
surprising degree of precision in pronouncing
French-English.&nbsp; He is now reading the newspaper to some of
his subscribers, with an audible voice, and repeatedly calls a
detached body of troops a <i>corpse</i>; a <i>tour</i> he
improves into a <i>tower</i>; and delivers his words in a
<i>promiscas</i> manner.&nbsp; It is near seven in the evening,
and the widow Fussic has just waddled into his shop, with a
parasol in her right, and a spying-glass in her left hand.&nbsp;
Thomas offers her a <i>General Advertiser</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord
bless me!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;Mr. Thomas, how damp this paper
is tho&rsquo; it it has come so far, and must have been printed
so long since!&nbsp; What reason can you give for
it?&rsquo;&mdash;Mr. Thomas observes, considers and explains, in
a most explicit manner, the cause and the effect, to the
inquisitive lady, naturally speaking, as a body may say; proving
to a demonstration, according to Candide, that there can be no
effect without a cause; and that of course, damp papers, closely
compressed, will continue damp a considerable time.&nbsp; In the
interim, Miss Fanny Fussic stares and whispers to her brother
Bobby, while he is subscribing to a raffle, that Mr. Thomas <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>must be a
most prodigious man, monstrously intelligent, and withal, that he
is amazingly communicative: &lsquo;He knows but
every-thing,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and tells but every-thing he
knows.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Library was also established on the Steine, on the
premises which had been known as Raggett&rsquo;s Subscription
House, at the opposite corner of St. James&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In this house,&rdquo; writes Mr. H. R. Attree, in his
Topography of Brighton, &ldquo;the dice are often rattled to some
tune, and bank-notes transferred from one hand to another, with
as little ceremony as bills of the play, or quack doctor&rsquo;s
draughts to their patients.&rdquo;&nbsp; This library was
established by Mr. Donaldson, jun., who disposed of it to Mr.
Osborne, from whom it passed to Mr. Nathaniel Turner.</p>
<p>Originally, beneath the balconies in front of the two
first-mentioned libraries, were seats, with and without reclining
backs, upon which, in genial weather, subscribers were accustomed
to lounge and peruse the newspaper or the last new novel of the
day.&nbsp; Cigars then were unknown, and short pipes had not come
into vogue, so that these retreats were not disfigured with the
notice &ldquo;No smoking allowed,&rdquo; as the
&ldquo;weed&rdquo; was not indulged in, except behind a long
&ldquo;churchwarden&rdquo; at the tavern, where gossips nightly
met to chat over the scandals of the day.&nbsp; Besides these
retreats beneath the balconies, there were open high-backed
seats, called Settles, much after the structure of rustic chairs
in parks and pleasure grounds, upon various parts of the
promenade around the Steine.&nbsp; At the bottom of the Steine,
also, facing the sea, was the Alcove, a summer-house kind of
building, capable of seating something like half-a-dozen
persons.&nbsp; Bew, <a name="citation200"></a><a
href="#footnote200" class="citation">[200]</a> in his diary,
date, Thursday, August 26th, 1779, says, &ldquo;This morning I
edged away towards the Alcove, at the east end of the bottom of
the Steyne, wherein were seated <i>two</i> Elders, and perhaps, a
<i>chaste Susanna</i>; at any rate, she was not naked.&nbsp; On
my approach they departed hastily, and I joined the deserted
lady&mdash;in discourse, by observing that the town was thin, and
that I heard trade in general was very bad.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
bad, indeed, Sir,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;I suppose you are a <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>fellow
sufferer.&nbsp; You belong to the players, Sir, don&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;why
should you think so?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Because you are seldom
without a book in your hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do few read
besides players, then?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, Sir, I beg
pardon; I had another reason; but you&rsquo;ll excuse
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed I will not my
dear.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Why then, Sir, as you advanced towards
us, one of those <i>elderly</i> gentlemen&mdash;by their
discourse I believe they are parsons,&mdash;said to the other,
&lsquo;Come, Sir, let us be gone, or we shall be taken off;
<i>Mr. Diarist</i> is coming this way.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
Sir, if that is your name, tho&rsquo; I have never seen it yet in
the play bills, was it wonderful that I should imagine you to be
one of the gentlemen players.&rsquo;&mdash;I assured her,
nevertheless, that I was not entitled to that honour; and here
you may imagine our conference ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another retreat for a lounge or promenade was the Colonnade
under the balcony of the library on the Marine Parade,
established in 1798, by Messrs. Donaldson and Wilkes, and
afterwards carried on by Mr. Pollard, and then by Messrs. Tuppen
and Walker.&nbsp; This library, and the original two on the
Steine, were not merely the resort of visitors for the purpose of
literary pursuits, as their name legitimately implies, but after
eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, during the Summer season,
that portion of the business in connexion with books ceased, and
holland blinds being drawn down to cover over the whole of the
books and book-shelves, a saloon was formed that nightly
attracted hundreds of <i>tonish</i> idlers to the vocal and
instrumental music that was discoursed, and to join in the
raffles, similar to those that were going on at Raggett&rsquo;s
subscription room.</p>
<p>Bew, in his Diary, date, Saturday, September 4th, 1799,
writes,&mdash;&ldquo;Every article of convenience, every trinket
of luxury, is transferred by this uncertain, quick mode of
conveyance.&nbsp; Not a shop without its
rattle-trap,&mdash;rattle, rattle, rattle, morning and
evening.&nbsp; Here may be seen,&mdash;walk in and see,&mdash;an
abridgment of the wisdom of this world;&mdash;the pomps and
vanities are at large, varying like yonder evanescent
clouds.&nbsp; Observe the fond parent initiating her forward
offspring in the use of the dice-box, and herself setting the
example; yet may she wonder, at some future day, and think her
throw in life&rsquo;s raffle extremely severe, that a propensity
to that and similar habits should continue and
increase.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Fisher, in August, 1805, established
a new Auction Mart in St. James&rsquo;s Street, that was open
morning and night.&nbsp; The following extracts from a private
diary will in some degree explain the rage which was on at those
periods for this and similar virulent pastimes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>August 2nd, 1792.&mdash;But little company stirred
out to-day, on account of the intense heat of the weather.&nbsp;
Sporting men of fashion, dashers, and blacklegs certainly
assembled on the Steine, to make their bets for to-morrow&rsquo;s
Lewes Races, where much excellent sport is expected.&nbsp; The
other part of the day was spent mostly in Raggett&rsquo;s
Subscription House, at Billiards, Dice, &amp;c.&nbsp; <i>On
dit.</i>&mdash;Lady Lade is returning from Brighton in much
dudgeon,&mdash;because, forsooth, Lady Jersey, she says, made
<i>wulgar</i> mouths at her yesterday on the race-ground!</p>
<p>July 23rd, 1805.&mdash;A very select and elegant assemblage of
nobility last night paraded the Steine until a late hour.&nbsp;
Donaldson&rsquo;s library, also, was very fashionably filled; and
Wilks&rsquo;s Pic-nic Auction exhibited a blaze of rank and
beauty.</p>
<p>August 23rd.&mdash;Wilks&rsquo;s bargains were in fashionable
request last night, and the knock-down blows of Fisher were
directed with his usual ability and effect.&nbsp; Fisher&rsquo;s
New Auction Lounge was again well filled with rank and beauty
this morning.&nbsp; A monster of the finny tribe has been
exhibited in a marquee, pitched purposely for the occasion, on
the Steine to-day.&nbsp; It is called a Star <i>Fish</i>, and is
so worthy the attention of the curious that it has divided the
attention of the public with <i>Fisher</i>.</p>
<p>August 27th.&mdash;Wilks&rsquo;s Auction Lounge, last night,
was immensely crowded until a late hour: nor has the magnetical
hammer of Fisher, at his new room, been less attractive this
morning.</p>
<p>September 21st, 1807.&mdash;Donaldson&rsquo;s and
Pollard&rsquo;s libraries have had crowded assemblages, and the
game of Loo has had more than its usual number of votaries.&nbsp;
This evening Mr Cartwright will perform at Fisher&rsquo;s Lounge,
on the musical glasses, under the patronage of Mrs Orby
Hunter.</p>
<p>October 8th.&mdash;Pam still possesses his original
attraction, and the Belles are nightly <i>looed</i> in his
presence.&mdash;Rather a <i>bad</i> pun that, eh?</p>
<p>May 9th, 1810.&mdash;Donaldson&rsquo;s and Walker&rsquo;s
spacious and airy Steine and Marine Lounges have not been so
interestingly decorated with rank and beauty as they have to-day
appeared for many preceding months, though the amusements of one
card loo, &amp;c., are not yet there introduced.&nbsp; The
diversion of raffling has not been permitted at either for some
years past, nor will it again be allowed, so long as the
Little-go Bill remains unrepealed; we may therefore conclude that
the rattle of the dice will never be heard at either again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trinket Auctions were established when an Act of Parliament,
called Mr. Vansittart&rsquo;s Little-go Bill, was passed, that
did away with raffling at all places of public resort, as the
profits to the librarians at the watering places generally, arose
from these diversions, rather than from the high literary
character of the <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>books upon their shelves, or the erudite position of
the persons whose names were in their subscription books because
fashion ruled it so.&nbsp; The novelty of Trinket Auctions soon
wore off, and then another pastime, under the name of Loo, was
introduced.&nbsp; The game was very diverting in its progress,
and afforded an occasion for many agreeable sallies of wit,
according to the talent of the conductor of it and the
disposition to replications of those about him.&nbsp; The Loo
Sweepstakes, as they were termed, were limited to eight
subscribers, and the individual stake, one shilling.&nbsp; The
full number being obtained, a certain quantity of cards, amongst
which was a Knave of Clubs, or Pam, were shuffled, cut, and
separately dealt and turned: the numbers were called in rotation
during the process, and that against which Pam appeared was
pronounced the winner.</p>
<p>In September, 1810, an attempt was made to constitute the game
of Loo an illegal act.&nbsp; For that purpose informations were
lodged against Messrs. Donaldson and Walker, the proprietors of
the Steine and Marine Libraries, and the case was heard at Lewes,
before a full Bench of Magistrates.&nbsp; Mr. Courthorpe was
counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Adolphus appeared for the
defendants.&nbsp; The only case that was argued was that of an
information against Mr. Walker, founded on the 12th of Geo. II.,
c. 28, and which was dwelt on with much force,&mdash;such indeed
as a confidence of success only could inspire&mdash;by Mr.
Courthorpe.&nbsp; To prove that defendant had offended within the
meaning of the Act, and consequently was liable to the penalty
therein expressed, i.e., two hundred pounds, Mrs. White, the wife
of one of the informers, was called and examined.&nbsp; This
witness hesitated considerably in her evidence, particularly when
interrogated by Mr. Adolphus, as to her motive in becoming a
subscriber to the Loo amusement at Walker&rsquo;s and whether or
not she had so acted with the solo aim and purpose of lodging an
information against Mr. Walker, which she at last admitted.&nbsp;
The substance of her evidence was &ldquo;That she attended at
Walker&rsquo;s library on the 30th of August; that she stood next
to Mr. Walker on that occasion; that she heard him say,
&lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen, three shillings are only wanting to
complete the sweepstake for this elegant Lady&rsquo;s Morocco
work <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>box;&rsquo; that she gave him a shilling for a chance,
when he asked her in what name she would have it, and she said
Mrs. Goodlove; that a lady at length shuffled and cut the cards;
that Mr. Walker dealt them; that the first dealt was called Mr.
Bangup; that she won Pam, and got the prize; that Mr. Walker told
her she had won it, and that she was to receive seven shillings
in goods, or subscribe an extra sixpence, and have two chances
for another box of much superior value; that she took the prize
she had won, and lost two shillings in other ventures,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; When questioned by the Earl of Chichester,
one of the magistrates, as to the real value of the prize that
had been nominated at 7s., her husband whispered to her what to
say; which being overheard by the Noble Earl, Mr. White was
compelled instantly to quit the room, and to wait without, that
he might be at hand in case he should be wanted.&nbsp; Mr.
Adolphus (the witness being dismissed) addressed the Bench in a
most able speech, concluding by producing an Act of Parliament
passed in 1806, by which he clearly evinced that the present
informations could not be sustained, as the said Act dispossessed
magistrates of all jurisdiction and control in matters of that
sort then before them.&nbsp; Mr. Courthorpe laboured hard,
notwithstanding, to gain his point; but as his oratory had not
the power to supersede an Act of Parliament, his labour was in
vain.&nbsp; As authorities in support of the Act he produced, Mr.
Adolphus was upheld by the opinion of the Attorney-General, and a
decision in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp; The
Magistrates, from what had been brought forward by Mr. Adolphus,
saw their incompetency in so strong a light, that they dismissed
the business, even without hearing the reply which Mr. Adolphus
was about to make to his learned friend.&nbsp; There were three
other informations, all of which of course were withdrawn.&nbsp;
The librarians returned home in high spirits, and the Loo
parties, subsequently, and exulting in the success of the day,
were more numerous than usual.</p>
<p>Pam, the good genius of Loo, continued to hold sway at the
libraries till 1817, when the magistrates took an antipathy
towards him, owing to the unbounded patronage which he received
from the ladies in general.&nbsp; They considered him an
unwelcome resident; so, by their mandate, supported by an
obsolete Act of Henry VIII., <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>he was excommunicated from all the
libraries, as, at this time he had taken up his abode at Mr. T.
H. Wright&rsquo;s Library, then just established at the
south-west corner of Pavilion Street.&nbsp; Gradually, however,
he resumed his position at the establishments of Lucombe and
Tuppen; but notwithstanding the presiding influence of those two
patterers and wits, assisted by Mr. Stacy, the present librarian
at the Royal Albion Rooms, and Mr. Wheeler, the box book-keeper
at the Brighton Theatre, the destruction of the fashionable
promenade, by curtailing the Steine of its fair proportions, so
distorted the throng and habit of fashion, that Pam fell into
desuetude and the libraries, unsupported by him, became
failures.</p>
<p>Five and twenty years since, Brighton abounded with libraries,
Wright&rsquo;s, in the Colonnade, North Street, removed from the
Pavilion Parade, and Eber&rsquo;s, in Castle Square, a branch of
the London establishment, being amongst the principal of those
that then existed.&nbsp; Furnishing food for the mind, however,
was a less profitable speculation than supplying materials for
the understandings, as Mr. Tozer on the former premises, and
Messrs. Dutton and Thorowgood on the latter, by the sale of boots
and shoes, have matured businesses that may vie with any of the
same trade in the kingdom.&nbsp; It is somewhat remarkable, too,
that a portion of the premises in Prince&rsquo;s Place, occupied
by Mr. Lulham, boot and shoemaker, and the house in the
occupation of Messrs. Sharman and Co., North Street, as a boot
and shoe mart, were the library of Mr. Taylor.&nbsp; These facts
certainly confirm the adage,&mdash;at any rate when besieged by
the multitude with a civil view,&mdash;that &ldquo;there is
nothing like leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From time to time libraries of more or less pretensions have
been started, either by private parties or by societies of
membership; but most of them have become things of the past,
which in their short lived career possessed nothing to warrant a
recital of their history.</p>
<p>The oldest established now in existence is Mr.
Folthorp&rsquo;s North Street Library, originally Choat&rsquo;s,
and then Loader&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is admirably situated, and has
a supply of books, periodicals, and newspapers equalled by no
other circulating library in the county.&nbsp; The only
proprietary literary establishments, with the <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>exception
of those attached to the several places of public worship and
their schools, are the Brighton Royal Literary and Scientific
Institution, Albion Rooms, to which a Chess Club is attached; the
Railway Library and Scientific Institution, for the use of
persons employed on the railway; and the Young Men&rsquo;s
Christian Association, in Middle Street.&nbsp; Some of the
booksellers have a lending library connected with their
businesses.&nbsp; The principal of these are Dollman&rsquo;s,
Western Road, and Burrett&rsquo;s, Waterloo Street, Hove;
Styles&rsquo;s, North Street, Sugg&rsquo;s St. James&rsquo;s
Street, and Grant&rsquo;s Library and Reading Room, Castle
Square.&nbsp; The literary character of which the Steine formerly
boasted is now entirely gone, and it is content to be considered
the emporium of the followers of Galen and &AElig;sculapius, who
as much there abound as the students of Coke and Blackstone
throng Ship Street, and give that locality of quips, quirks, and
the law&rsquo;s delays the appellation of Chancery Lane.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter </span>XXIX.<br />
THE THEATRES.</h2>
<p>Besides the Assembly Rooms at the Castle Tavern and the Old
Ship Hotel, and the Libraries, the Theatre has been, and still
is, a place of fashionable resort in Brighton.&nbsp; The remnant
of the first Theatre ever erected in the town has recently been
restored to public notice in consequence of the premises
undergoing alterations in the process of converting them into ale
and porter stores, by Messrs. Charlton and Co.&nbsp; They are
situated in North Street, and are approached by a doorway between
the shops of Messrs. Cunditt, jewellers, and Mr. Pritchard,
confectioner.&nbsp; To the old inhabitants they are better known
as Wallis&rsquo;s wine and spirit vaults; and at a recent date
they were occupied by Mr. Cordy, the son-in-law and successor of
Mr. Wallis.&nbsp; In 1789 they were used as the printing office
of Messrs. William and Arthur Lee, who in a few years removed
their establishment to Lewes, and then Mr. Wallis took possession
of them.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>In
this building David Garrick displayed his inimitable histrionic
talent.&nbsp; The main structure and its original front have long
since passed away: but the stage yet remains entire, with its
several traps and appointments.&nbsp; An excellent portrait of
Garrick till lately graced the wall, but the modern destroyer of
many a work of art, whitewash, has entirely obliterated every
feature of it.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from the Diary of Mr.
Bew:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1778.&mdash;Tuesday, September 1.&mdash;<i>The
Settle</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Steine</span>.&mdash;Mr.
Griffith, of <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>Drury Lane playhouse, with much civility, conducts me
to the Theatre, in North Street, in which <i>company</i> he is
<i>concerned</i>, am fearful the manager is most
<i>concerned</i>, at&mdash;the badness of the season, for there
seems a <i>plentiful lack</i> of company.&nbsp; But, not to play
too much upon words, it is a pretty building, something larger
than that at Richmond, and seems well adapted to its intended
uses.</p>
<p>Friday, 4.&mdash;<i>At the Theatre</i>.&mdash;In the evening
went to Griffith&rsquo;s benefit, the <i>West Indian</i>, by
desire of Lady Mills; much, but pleasingly disappointed, because
the company performed a great deal better than from information I
had been taught to expect; the ladies also were, what all
stage-ladies not always are,&mdash;extremely decent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previous to 1774 there was no other temple dedicated to Thalia
and Melpomene, than a barn.&nbsp; The first theatre was built by
the late Mr. Samuel Paine, and let in 1774, to Mr. Roger
Johnstone, formerly the property-man at Covent Garden Theatre,
who, having continued it for three years only, it was then leased
to the late Mr. Fox, of Covent Garden Theatre also, in 1777, for
the term of fifteen years, at the annual rent of sixty
guineas.</p>
<p>It was understood, however, between the lessor and the lessee,
that the former, in addition, was to have the <i>net receipts</i>
of the house on one night, to be called his benefit night, clear
of all expenses, in every succeeding year; and that <i>his
family</i> should be free of the theatre, or possess the right of
witnessing the performances there, at all times, without being
liable to any charge as the consequence of their visits.</p>
<p>The latter stipulation was correctly introduced into the
covenants of the lease, but not so the former, <i>net profits</i>
being there stipulated instead of <i>net receipts</i>; the issue
of which was, that Mr. Paine was called on to defray the expenses
of his first benefit night, contrary to what had previously been
understood, and orally agreed upon, between him and Mr. Fox.</p>
<p>This circumstance had nearly given rise to an unpleasant
litigation between the parties; in which Mr. Paine, in all
probability, would have been the sufferer, for the want of a
document to establish the propriety of his claim; but such a
mortification and injury he preserved himself from, by having
recourse to the following expedient:&mdash;</p>
<p>The right of gratuitous admission to the theatre, to himself
and family, as above specified, was undisputed; and as no place
in the house was stipulated as the only part they should be
permitted to <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>enter in their visits, he determined to avail himself
of his privilege to the full extent of its bearing.&nbsp; He,
therefore, collected his family together, and with them entered
the theatre for a succession of nights, resolutely occupying the
best seats in the boxes, to the exclusion of other and more
profitable applicants.</p>
<p>The manager, thus opposed, and law and equity pronounced by
the public as both in favour of Mr. Paine, consented to ratify
his first agreement, and the system of warfare adopted to harass
and punish him, ceased.&nbsp; Before the expiration of the
fifteen years&rsquo; lease the house was found inadequate to the
accommodation of the increased population of the town, and a new
one was erected in Duke Street.&nbsp; The license for the theatre
was yearly obtained from the magistrates at the Quarter Sessions
at Lewes; and Mr. Fox, on finishing the house in Duke Street,
applied for the removal of the license to that place.&nbsp; His
application was granted, no opposition being offered to the
measure by Mr. Paine.</p>
<p>The latter, however, discovered the error of his
non-resistance before the next application for the license became
requisite, when his opposition to it was a matter of course; but
which proved ineffectual from the delay, and the license was
granted to the same house, on which, without opposition, it had
been bestowed the year before.&nbsp; The family of Paine were,
therefore, pecuniary sufferers of several hundred pounds per
annum by this event, and for which the only compensation ever
received fell short of one hundred and twenty pounds, or
guineas.</p>
<p>On the death of Mr. Fox, the Duke Street Theatre was purchased
by H. Cobb, Esq., of Clement&rsquo;s Inn, who built the present
house in the New Road, 1807, and removed the license thereto,
having first satisfied the ground-landlord in respect to the
measure.</p>
<p>The building had a plain front of wood, drawn out to imitate
blocks of stone, unpierced with windows, and was approached by a
semi-circular carriage and foot-way from the street, as it was
set back from the main road to nearly the present frontage of Mr.
Patching&rsquo;s house, on the site of which the Theatre then
stood.&nbsp; The projecting entrance to the Boxes, in the centre
of the front, was by a Grecian portico supported by four Tuscan
pillars, from which branched brackets supporting two round <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>shaped oil
lamps.&nbsp; The buildings abutting east and west had also
similar lamps.&nbsp; The Pit and Gallery entrances were on the
east side, approached by an external passage, that had a door,
over which was painted &ldquo;Pit and Gal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stage
door was a little to the west of the principal entrance, where
the word &ldquo;Boxes&rdquo; was conspicuously painted.&nbsp;
Five posts divided the footway on each side of the portico.&nbsp;
A print of the Theatre was published in London, April 1st, 1804,
by T. Woodfall, Villiers&rsquo; Street, Strand, and several
figures therein exhibit the peculiar fashion of the day in
dress.&nbsp; The license to this Theatre Royal was granted by a
special Act of Parliament, which passed in the year 1788.</p>
<p>An anecdote connected with this Theatre, and noted in
&ldquo;Brighton Past and Present,&rdquo; by Mrs. Merrifield, is
worthy of quotation:&mdash;&ldquo;It was during the time that Fox
was manager that the celebrated Mrs. Jordan trod these boards as
an actress.&nbsp; A friend of mine, who sometimes visited the
green room, one day found her in great distress, threatened by a
Sheriff&rsquo;s Officer, on account of the debt of an extravagant
brother.&nbsp; Mrs. Jordan solicited my friend to become surety
for her.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I went into the room,&rsquo; said my
friend, &lsquo;I thought her one of the plainest little women I
had ever seen, but I had not been in her company half-an-hour
before I thought her charming.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is almost
unnecessary to say that he complied with her request, and
relieved this fascinating actress from her embarassment; nor had
he cause to repent of his goodnature, for Mrs. Jordan paid the
debt as soon as she was able, and thus released him from his
engagement.&rdquo;</p>

theatre:</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Brighton New Guide,&rdquo; 1800, published by
Fisher, Old Steine, says: &ldquo;The scenes are painted by Mr.
Carver, of Covent-Garden Theatre, and they do honour to the
abilities of that ingenious artist; and if the abilities of the
actors are not sufficiently powerful to excite the enthusiasm of
applause, they are not so contemptible as to create
disgust.&nbsp; Candour must acknowledge, that the theatrical
business at Brighthelmston is conducted with great regularity,
and that if perfection is not reached, mediocrity is
surpassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1672, a tax on plays was proposed; but the court party
objected to it.&nbsp; They said the players were the King&rsquo;s
servants, and administered to his pleasures.&nbsp; Sir John
Coventry pleasantly asked, &ldquo;Whether the King&rsquo;s
pleasures lay among the male or the <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>female actors?&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles,
who, besides his other mistresses, entertained two actresses,
Mrs. Davis and Nell Gwynne, was hurt by this sarcasm, and took an
unworthy revenge.&nbsp; Some of his guards attacked Coventry, and
slit his nose.&nbsp; The Commons expressed their indignation, by
passing what is called the Coventry Act, by which maiming and
deforming were made capital crimes, and those persons who had
assaulted Coventry were rendered incapable of receiving the
King&rsquo;s pardon.</p>
<p>In July, 1805, when the Prince of Wales bestowed his patronage
upon the Duke Street Theatre, and first attached to it the
gracious adjective, &ldquo;Royal,&rdquo; great improvements were
effected in the house, those in his Royal Highness&rsquo;s box
particularly so: blue panels, with sparkling gold stars, on a
dark ground, and ornamented with festoons of roses, superbly
distinguished it; a crimson curtain of velvet depending from the
ceiling also heightened the effect, and gave an indescribable
appearance of grandeur to the whole.&nbsp; The box was also
carpeted throughout, and handsome painted chairs with cushions in
lieu of fixed seats, made part of its furniture.</p>
<p>On the 13th of August, 1805, a piece was produced in honour of
the birthday of the Prince of Wales, and was called <i>The
Twelfth of August</i>.&nbsp; The plot of the piece was:
&ldquo;Sofa Hazleby,&rdquo; the daughter of an opulent farmer, a
resident of Brighton, who has numerous suitors, has promised to
become the bride of him who can give the best solution to a
question which she will submit to their consideration on the
Green, on the Twelfth of August; and the reason she assigns for
choosing that day for a decision so momentous to her, is because
it gave birth to England&rsquo;s Heir,&mdash;a Prince whose
suavity of manners, benevolence of heart, and mental endowments
have rendered him the pride of his country and the admiration of
Europe.&nbsp; &ldquo;That auspicious morn,&rdquo; she continues,
&ldquo;could but appear to me as most grateful and best adapted
to my purpose, in which every honest countenance I might gaze at
should be brightened with exulting smiles.&rdquo;&mdash;The
preceding part of the drama being over, in which her eccentric
suitors afforded much mirth to the audience, the final scene
presents a supposed view of the South Downs, and the entrance of
Brighton, the latter brilliantly <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>illuminated, the initials P. W., the
feathers, and a blazing star, being appropriately
conspicuous.</p>
<p>In 1799, Mr. Alexander Archer was manager of the Duke Street
Theatre.&nbsp; Upon stripping the paper from the walls of 34,
Bond Street, on the 20th of May, in the present year, to effect
some alterations, a relic in the character of a &ldquo;play
bill,&rdquo; was brought to light.&nbsp; It is thus worded:
&ldquo;Engagement of Mr. Quick.&nbsp; Doors open at half-past
six.&nbsp; Begin precisely at 7 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Mr.
Quick&rsquo;s fifth night.&nbsp; Theatre Brighthelmston.&nbsp; On
Tuesday, July 13th, 1802, will be performed the admired comedy of
<i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>; the part of &lsquo;Tony
Lumpkin,&rsquo; by Mr. Quick.&nbsp; After which will be added
<i>St. Patrick&rsquo;s-Day</i>, <i>or the Scheming
Lieutenant</i>.&nbsp; Lee, Printer, Brighton.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
house had just been vacated by the descendants of Johnson, who
for many years was the bill-sticker of the town.&nbsp; The first
stone of the present Theatre was laid on the 24th of September,
1806, by Mr. Brunton, senr.; and the building was opened on
Saturday, the 6th of June, 1807, with the tragedy of
<i>Hamlet</i>, when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kemble represented the
Prince and Ophelia.</p>
<p>The <i>Brighton Ambulator</i>&mdash;a publication almost
extinct,&mdash;thus speaks of the present theatre as it was when
opened by the first lessee, Mr. Trotter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">the
theatre</span>.</p>
<p>This place of public amusement is situated in the New Road,
leading into North Street.&nbsp; It is a very handsome structure,
having a colonnade, which runs along its whole front, supported
by neat stone pillars.&nbsp; The entrance into the Boxes is in
the centre; and that to the Pit is on the right, and the Gallery
on the left of the building.</p>
<p>The interior has two tier of boxes.&nbsp; The Prince
Regent&rsquo;s box is on the left of the stage, divided from the
other boxes by an iron lattice work, gilded, which gives it a
pleasing and private appearance.&nbsp; The pit and gallery are
well constructed for the audience, particularly the latter, which
has a prominent view of the stage.</p>
<p>The house is illuminated by nine cut-glass chandeliers, and a
range of patent lamps at the foot of the stage.&nbsp; The stage
is exceedingly convenient, and has a length proportioned to the
structure.&nbsp; The whole is fitted up with a tasteful elegance,
and we must acknowledge, that it reflects honour on the
discriminate judgment of Mr. Trotter, the manager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This account of the theatre describes it as it was more than
half a century since; as of late years it has been, externally
and internally, greatly modernized: although the chief lighting
<a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>attraction in its transition from oil and wax to gas, a
noble and well supplied chandelier, which was lowered and raised
at pleasure over the centre of the pit, has long since been
removed, the light from it detracting from the scenic effect, and
the great heat which it disseminated militating against the
comfort of the audience, especially the &ldquo;gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present Owner of the property is George Cobb, Esq., an
Alderman of the Borough of Brighton, who, a few years since,
purchased of the executors of the late Sir Thomas Clarges the
moiety which that baronet held.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, in his latter days, was what is modernly termed, a
little &ldquo;cracky&rdquo; in the cranium.&nbsp; Just about the
period of the murder of the Italian boy, by Bishop and Williams,
when pitch plasters were in vogue, and were as much terrors in
the public mind as garottings now are, Sir Thomas had a pony
which he imagined was unwell, and beyond the aid of veterinary
skill.&nbsp; He therefore, with the manual service of his groom,
undertook to cure it himself, and thus proceeded:&mdash;He
procured a sheet of canvass, which he spread with a composition
of pitch, tar, and tallow, and in this cere-cloth he encased the
body of the animal, and twice daily, in the midst of Summer, took
it, with merely a horse-cloth over it, on the Race-hill and
submitted it to severe exercise, the groom walking it briskly,
and himself riding beside it on horseback for two hours at a
stretch.&nbsp; His intention was to pursue this course till all
the virtue in the composition would become absorbed by the
afflicted system of the animal, when its cure would be effected
and the canvass would of its own accord drop off.&nbsp; The
severity, however, of the process, was too much for the poor
creature; for having borne the punishment somewhat more than a
week, one morning, when Sir Thomas and his man went to the stable
in Rock Mews, where a box had been specially fitted up, the
straight-jacketed small edition of a horse was a stiffened
corpse.</p>
<p>Immediately previous to her retirement from the stage, Mrs.
Siddons filled an engagement here for three nights, namely,
Tuesday, August 8th, 1809, as &ldquo;Mrs. Beverley&rdquo; in
<i>The Gamester</i>, <a name="citation214"></a><a
href="#footnote214" class="citation">[214]</a> <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Tuesday,
15th, as &ldquo;Lady Macbeth,&rdquo; and on Thursday, 18th, as
&ldquo;Isabella,&rdquo; in the tragedy of that name.&nbsp; The
receipts of the house for the 15th, amounted to &pound;172 16s, a
sum by far exceeding that which the Theatre could boast of having
held on any night previous.&nbsp; On August 29th, she also
appeared as &ldquo;Margaret of Anjou,&rdquo; in the tragedy of
<i>Earl of Warwick</i>, for the benefit of Mr. Murray, on which
occasion the receipts amounted to &pound;150 5s; and on September
12th, as &ldquo;Lady Macbeth,&rdquo; for the benefit of Mr.
Cresswell.&nbsp; On the last occasion Mr. Charles Kemble, for the
first time on any stage, made his appearance as
&ldquo;Macbeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every actor of celebrity has trodden
the boards of the Brighton Theatre, which has been the nursery
for supplying many first-rate performers to the patent houses of
the Metropolis.&nbsp; At a Masquerade which took place here,
October 8th, 1812, a great disturbance arose in consequence of
Theodore Hook and his friends appearing unmasked.</p>
<p>The several lessees have been Mr. Trotter, Mr. Grove, Mr.
Brunton, sen.,&mdash;father of the late Dowager Countess of
Craven, who at the time of her marriage was acting on the stage
of this Theatre, in her father&rsquo;s company,&mdash;Messrs.
Jonas and Penley, Mr. (Romeo) Coates, Mr. John Brunton, jun., Mr.
(Jerry) Russell,&mdash;when the house was open only on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays,&mdash;Messrs. Bew and Vining, Mr.
Charles Hill, Messrs. Walton and Holmes,&mdash;a
commonwealth,&mdash;Messrs. Saville and Harroway, Mr. Hooper, Mr.
Poole, Captain Belcour, Mr. H. Farren, and the present respected
lessee, Mr. H. Nye Chart.&nbsp; Formerly, the season extended
from July to October; now the house usually continues open from
the latter end of July until the beginning of March.</p>
<p>Upon the completion of the present Theatre in the New Road, a
permanent building for a Circus was erected on the Grand Parade,
between Carlton Street and the weigh-bridge, which, for obtaining
the weight of the loads in the waggons and carts that traversed
the turnpike road to Lewes, stood at the spot that forms the
bottom of Sussex Street.&nbsp; It was completed by Messrs.
Kendall and Co., and opened in August, 1808.&nbsp; The building
had a frontage of neat design, in width one hundred feet, which
was also its depth, that extended into Circus Street.&nbsp; A
wing to the north of the Circus was appropriated for a billiard
lounge, confectionary, &amp;c.; and the <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>corresponding wing to the south for a coffee-house and
hotel.&nbsp; The representation of a prancing horse surmounted
the centre of the structure.</p>
<p>The only incident worthy of record which took place in this
building during the few years that it was devoted to equestrian
exhibitions, was an accident which befel the daughter of the
lessee, Mr. Saunders, on the evening of Monday, August 28th,
1809, on the occasion of a bespeak of the Duke of Marlborough,
when, while riding round the ring, which was thirty-six feet in
diameter, Miss Saunders lost her equilibrium and fell.&nbsp; She
was borne away insensible, amidst the intense anxiety of a most
fashionable audience.&nbsp; The announcement, however, of the
Acting Manager, Mr. Clark, that she had received but a slight
injury, gave a salutary relief to all present.&nbsp; At her
benefit, which took place on the previous Thursday, under the
patronage of Lord and Lady Somerset, the house was crowded in
every part.</p>
<p>In 1812 the Circus closed from want of support, and for a few
years the premises were occupied as a Bazaar, a speculation which
was quite a failure, although every inducement in the way of
loos, lotteries, and lucky-bags, was introduced, with occasional
displays of fireworks and the ascents of fire-balloons from the
parade ground opposite, now the extreme north Enclosure.&nbsp; At
that period, and for some years afterwards, the land northward
from the Pavilion boundary wall to the Level was enclosed with
posts and rails in areas like the present, and formed a public
promenade, and the parade ground of the military.&nbsp; How it
became enclosed with iron railings and planted with trees and
flowers, to the exclusion of the inhabitants, has never been
satisfactorily explained.&nbsp; Occasionally attempts have been
made to investigate the business; but inasmuch as money is
required for such a purpose, and the majority of the ratepayers
are contented with the excellent manner the Enclosures are
conducted, they allow the Trustees who have possessed themselves
of the right, to continue in undisturbed possession.</p>
<p>From time to time since the demolition of the Grand Parade
Circus, various troupes of equestrians have visited
Brighton.&nbsp; Saunders&rsquo;s was the first, his exhibition,
which took place on the present site of St. George&rsquo;s Place,
being termed a Mountebank <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>performance, and consisting, besides
feats of horsemanship, of such tricks as are witnessed in shows
at fairs and races.&nbsp; On Thursday evening, June 21st, 1821,
from six to eight thousand persons assembled to witness the
equestrian exploits, &amp;c., of this company.&nbsp; In the midst
of the amusements one of the scaffoldings, on which were nearly a
hundred persons,&mdash;men, women, and children,&mdash;gave way,
and the whole fell to the ground, a depth of about four or five
feet.&nbsp; Many persons received severe bruises, and Mr. Siller,
of His Majesty&rsquo;s private band, had his leg broken in two
places.&nbsp; The chief prop of the scaffolding was some slight
paling, the yielding of which to the great pressure above
occasioned the accident, which, under the circumstances, might
have produced far more serious results, as many persons were
immediately under it at the moment.&nbsp; Cook and
Bridges&mdash;familiarly known to the juveniles of the time as
&ldquo;Cook and Breeches,&rdquo;&mdash;afterwards came and took
up their position on the Level; and then followed Ryan, Cooke,
Batty, Tournaire, &amp;c., in more or less permanent buildings;
followed by the flying visits of troupes in mammoth tents.&nbsp;
The last erection for the exhibition of horsemanship, and that
still in existence, is the affair in Sussex Street, the hitherto
success of which is evidence that the intelligent portion of the
community have not failed to appreciate the talent which has been

BRIGHTON FROM ITS SIMPLICITY TO ITS PRESENT RENOWN.</h2>
<p>The primitive state of Brighthelmston, both as respects the
condition and habits of the inhabitants and the position and
style of the habitations, must to a considerable extent be left
to conjecture, as there is no doubt the great changes which have
taken place in and about the town to give it the importance which
it at present <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>possesses as England&rsquo;s &ldquo;Queen of Watering
Places,&rdquo; have all been effected within the last 150
years.</p>
<p>An engraving in &ldquo;The Antiquities of England and
Wales,&rdquo; published in 1775, <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a> showing the ruins
of the Blockhouse at that period, gives a representation of the
houses on the Cliff at the spot whereon now stand the Old Ship
Hotel and the premises adjacent.&nbsp; The south end of
Black-lion Street is very conspicuous, the corner houses
consisting only of dwellings one story in height, of a cottage or
hovel-like appearance, very singular in architectural design when
compared with the present noble block of buildings of Messrs.
Hedges and Butler, the wine merchants, on the east side.</p>
<p>The author of a &ldquo;Tour through Great Britain,&rdquo;
date, 1724, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Bright Helmston, commonly called
Bredhemston, is a poor fishing town, old built, and on the very
edge of the sea.&nbsp; The fishermen have large barks, in which
they go away to Yarmouth, on the coast of Norfolk, to the fishing
fair there, and hire themselves for the season to catch herrings
for the merchants; and they tell us that these make a very good
business of it.&nbsp; The sea is very unkind to this town, and
has, by its continued encroachments, so gained upon it that in a
little time more they might reasonably expect it would eat up the
whole town, above one hundred houses having been devoured by the
water in a few years past; and they are now obliged to get a
brief granted them to beg money all over England, to raise banks
against the water; the expense of which, the brief expressly
says, will be eight thousand pounds; which, if one were to look
on the town, would seem to be more than all the houses in it are
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. William Clarke, Rector of Buxted, and grandfather of
the celebrated traveller, thus writes to his friend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Brighthelmston, July 22,
1736.</p>
<p>Dear Bowyer,</p>
<p>We are now sunning ourselves upon the beach at Brighthelmston,
and observing what a tempting figure this Island made formerly in
the eyes of those gentlemen who were pleased to civilize and
subdue it.&nbsp; Such a tract of sea; such regions of corn; and
such an extent of fine carpet, that gives your eye the command of
it all.&nbsp; But then the mischief is, that we have little
conversation <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>besides the <i>clamor nauticus</i>, which is here a
sort of treble to the plashing of the waves against the
cliffs.&nbsp; My morning business is bathing in the sea, and then
buying fish; the evening is riding out for air, viewing the
remains of old Saxon camps, and counting the ships in the road,
and the boats that are trawling.&nbsp; Sometimes we give the
imagination leave to expatiate a little;&mdash;fancy that you are
coming down, and that we intend next week to dine one day in
Dieppe, in Normandy; the price is already fixed, and the wine and
lodgings there tolerably good.&nbsp; But though we build these
castles in the air, I assure you that we live here <i>almost
underground</i>.&nbsp; I fancy the architects here usually take
the altitude of the inhabitants, and lose not an inch between the
head and the ceiling, and then dropping a step or two below the
surface, the second story is finished something under 12
feet.&nbsp; I suppose this was a necessary precaution against
storms, that a man should not be blown out of his bed into New
England, Barbary, or God knows where.&nbsp; But as the lodgings
are <i>low</i> they are cheap; we have <i>two parlours</i>,
<i>two bed chambers</i>, <i>pantry</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, for 5s
per week; and if you will really come down you need not fear a
bed of the proper dimensions.&nbsp; And then the coast is safe;
the cannons are all covered with rust and grass; the ships
moored, and no enemy apprehended.&nbsp; Come and see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nec tela temeres<br />
Gallica, nec Pictum tremeres nec littore toto<br />
Prospiceres dubiis ventura Saxona ventis.</p>
<p>My wife does not forget her good wishes and compliments upon
this occasion.&nbsp; How you would surprise all your friends in
Fleet Street, to tell them you were just come from France, with a
vivacity that everybody would believe to be just imported from
thence!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this year, 1736, the poor rates were eight pence in the
pound on the rack rent, &ldquo;which was then,&rdquo; says
Dunvan, &ldquo;an intolerable burthen.&rdquo;&nbsp; About this
time visitors of distinction began annually, in Summer, as soon
as the deep roads of Sussex became passable with any degree of
convenience, to frequent the town; but lodging-houses had not
then been put in requisition, the only accommodation being a few
indifferent inns; and the principal diversions were hunting,
occasional horse-racing, and water excursions.</p>
<p>About the year 1750 the medical use of sea-water in scrofulous
and other glandular complaints, under the unwearied and
successful attention of Dr. Richard Russell, who removed hither
from his seat at Malling, near Lewes, established his fame and
also that of the town all over the kingdom.&nbsp; He may in truth
be considered the founder of Brighton&rsquo;s greatness; and it
is much to be regretted that the inhabitants while appreciating
the laudable services and good qualities of modern Royal and
Noble patrons, and perpetuating individual virtues by works of
art in marble and on canvass, have hitherto omitted to mark their
gratitude to the memory of the <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>learned Doctor, there being amongst
the treasures of the town no memento whatever of him.&nbsp; His
portrait, it is true, graces the Telemachus room of the Old Ship
Hotel, but it might as well be stowed away in the ex-clock tower
of the Pavilion, so rarely have the public an opportunity of
seeing it.&nbsp; This hint perhaps may induce the possessor of
the portrait to make a present of it to the Corporation, who have
recently received several additions by gift to their choice
collection of paintings.</p>
<p>The erection of lodging-houses soon became a profitable
speculation in Brighton, and that late obscure fishing village
began to increase in population and celebrity.&nbsp; The
wonderful success of the industry and discernment of Dr. Russell
appeared by several cases of cures which he cited in his work,
&ldquo;A Dissertation on the use of Sea-water;&rdquo; and the
most eminent members of the faculty in England bore willing
testimony to the great acuteness and utility of his professional
investigations.&nbsp; The benefits which the diseased have ever
since received from sea-water are, therefore, in a great measure,
to be imputed to the medical labours and sagacity of this good
man, in grateful commemoration of whom the proprietors of a new
street,&mdash;the first that was erected, composed principally of
lodging-houses for the accommodation of invalid
visitors,&mdash;named it after him, Russell Street, many of the
original houses of which that still remain, though now occupied
by a different class of persons than those for whom they were
designed, show the improvement that had then taken place in house
property.&nbsp; The Rev. Dr. Mannington, of Jevington, in the
following epigram, simply, yet elegantly estimates the
philanthropical abilities of Dr. Russell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Clara per omne &aelig;vum Russelli fama
manebit,<br />
Dum retinet vires unda marina suas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Admiring ages Russell&rsquo;s fame shall know,<br
/>
Till ocean&rsquo;s healing waters cease to flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Russell&rsquo;s son, William&mdash;afterwards Mr. Sergeant
Kempe, on assuming the name of his maternal
grandfather,&mdash;however, who appeared to have been one of the
wits of the town at that period, by the following lines, knew the
limit of his father&rsquo;s skill:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Brighthelmston was confess&rsquo;d by all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; T&rsquo; abound with females fair;<br />
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>But more
so since fam&rsquo;d Russell has<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prefer&rsquo;d the waters there.</p>
<p>Then fly that dang&rsquo;rous town, ye swains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fear ye shall endure<br />
A pain from some bright sparkling eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which Russell&rsquo;s skill can&rsquo;t cure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Russell died in 1759, aged 72 years, and was interred in
the family vault at South Malling, on the 25th of December.&nbsp;
He was the son of Mr. Nathaniel Russell, a surgeon and apothecary
of Lewes, and clandestinely married the only daughter of Mr.
William Kempe, of South Malling.&nbsp; After his marriage he
studied at the University of Leyden, and received instruction
under the learned Boerhaave.&nbsp; His death took place in
London.&nbsp; Dr. A. Relhan was his worthy successor, inasmuch as
he fully developed the causes of the salubrity of Brighton, the
invaluable efficacy of sea-bathing, and the medical virtues of
the chalybeate spring, at the Wick, now the property of Sir
Francis Goldsmid.&nbsp; In his &ldquo;Treatise on the Salubrity
of the Town and Neighbourhood,&rdquo; the Doctor
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The town, (June, 1761,) at present consists of six
principal streets, many lanes, and some spaces surrounded with
houses, called by the inhabitants squares. <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; The great plenty of flint stones
on the shore and in the neighbouring cornfields, enabled them to
build the walls of their houses with that material, when in their
most impoverished state.&nbsp; At present they ornament the
windows and doors with the admirable brick which they burn for
their own use.&nbsp; The town improves daily, as the inhabitants,
encouraged by the late great resort of company, seem disposed to
expend the whole of what they acquire, in erecting new buildings,
or improving the old ones.&nbsp; Here are two public rooms, the
one convenient, the other not only so, but elegant, (the Old
Ship), not excelled perhaps by any in England, that of York
excepted.</p>
<p>The <i>endemial</i> or popular disorders of temperate people
being the product of air and diet, the best proof of the
healthfulness of the air of any place is deduced from the
customary longevity of the inhabitants, and the rate of the Bills
of Mortality.&nbsp; By the poor&rsquo;s rate of this parish,
there are 400 families in Brighton, each of these may be supposed
to contain five souls (the common calculation in England is six
in a family), and consequently the number of inhabitants,
exclusive of those supported in the work-house, who, at a medium,
amounted to 35, may be estimated at 2,000.</p>
<p>In seven years, beginning with 1753, and 1752, the baptisms
were 388, and the burials 227; so that the baptisms were annually
to the deaths, nearly as five to three.</p>
<p>But as the dissenters are nearly a tenth of the whole, I may
be allowed to add to the number of baptisms 35 for the seven
years, which is five annually, <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and nearly a-tenth, and makes the
whole of the baptisms 423 to 227 burials.&nbsp; By this the
baptisms are annually to the deaths as 60 to 32, which is nearly
two births to one death.&nbsp; In London there is annually a
death in every 32 persons, which is nearly two to one in favour
of Brighton.</p>
<p>With regard to the sea water at this place, it appears by
experiments that in Summer (weather tolerably dry) there are in
every pint of it at least five drachms and fifteen grains of
defecated salt; about five of bittern, or a decomposed earth,
attracting humidity from the air; and six grains of white
calcarious earth.&nbsp; This proportion of clean contents, being
nearly a twenty-third of the whole, is as great, or perhaps
greater, than is to be found in the sea water of any other port
in England, and must be owing to its peculiar distance from the
rivers, it being further from such, I apprehend, than any other
sea port in England.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Coe, writing in 1766, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Brighton is a
small ill-built town, situated on the sea-coast, at present
greatly resorted to in the Summer season by persons labouring
under various diseases, for the benefit of sea bathing, and
drinking sea water; and by the gay and polite on account of the
company which frequent it at this season.&nbsp; Until within a
few years it was no better than a mere fishing town, inhabited by
fishermen and sailors; but through the recommendation of Dr.
Russell, and his writings in favour of sea water, it has become
one of the principal places in the kingdom.&nbsp; It contains six
principal streets, five of which are parallel with each other,
and are terminated by the sea, namely, East Street, Black-lion
Street, Ship Street, Middle Street, and West Street; and North
Street runs along the other ends of the five, from the Assembly
Rooms, kept by Mr. Shergold, almost to the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. William Gilpin, <a name="citation222"></a><a
href="#footnote222" class="citation">[222]</a> in his
&ldquo;Observations on the Coasts of Hampshire, Sussex, and
Kent,&rdquo; made in the summer of 1774,
observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Soon after, we reached Brighthelmstone, a
disagreeable place.&nbsp; There is scarcely an object either in
it or near it of nature or of art, that strikes the eye with any
degree of beauty,&rdquo; and then in a somewhat contradictory
manner, adds:&mdash;&ldquo;One of the most picturesque sights we
met with at Brighthelmstone, was the sailing of a fleet of
mackarel-boats to take their evening station for fishing, which
they commonly continue through the night.&nbsp; The sun was just
setting when all appeared to be alive.&nbsp; Every boat began to
<a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>weigh
anchor and unmoor.&nbsp; It was amusing to see them under so many
different forms.&nbsp; Some in a still calm with flagging sails,
were obliged to assist their motion with oars; others were just
getting into the breeze, which rippled the water around them, and
began gently to swell their sails; while the fleet, the water,
and the whole horizon, glowed with one rich harmonious tint from
the setting sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. P. Hill, in her &ldquo;Apology,&rdquo; <a
name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a>&mdash;now a very rare work,&mdash;in
1787, five years after the Prince of Wales first honoured the
town with his presence, complains of the &ldquo;doors opening
direct into the sittings rooms,&rdquo; and of the
&ldquo;inconvenience of not being able to be &lsquo;out&rsquo; to
any visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bew writes, Sunday, August 30th, 1778:&mdash;&ldquo;This town
is built on spots, in patches, and for want of regularity does
not appear to advantage: every man, as to building, seems to have
done what appeared right in his own eyes.&nbsp; Here is no
magistracy: if there is an affray, the parties must go as far as
Lewes, which is much the prettier town, to have it settled.&nbsp;
Upon recollection, this town may be quieter for having no trading
justices resident on the spot.&nbsp; Am since informed, a
gentleman in the commission of the peace attends here
occasionally from Lewes.&mdash;There can be no antiquities; for
Brighthelmston was only a small obscure village, occupied by
fishermen, till silken Folly and bloated Disease, under the
auspices of a Dr. Russell, deemed it necessary to crowd the
shore, and fill the inhabitants with contempt for their
visitors.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; also, Tuesday,
September 7th, 1779, he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Am viewing my worthy
friend, Mr. Bull&rsquo;s house, or rather box, upon the Clift,
between Ship Street and Black-lion Street.&mdash;He beckons me
in, and shews it throughout.&nbsp; It is one pretty room to the
height of three stories, with a semicircular window comprising
most of the front, <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>and on each floor overlooking the sea all ways, which
makes the situation most delightful.&nbsp; The ground whereon it
stands is copyhold&mdash;indeed the ground in and about Brighton
is mostly so&mdash;measuring nearly eighteen feet square.&nbsp;
The fine is both certain and small.&nbsp; About fifty years ago,
this piece of land was sold for four pounds; thirty years since,
a purchaser gave eleven; and about this time two years, the
Alderman bought it for one hundred pounds to build
upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The premises here referred to are 35,
King&rsquo;s road, those in the occupation of Mr. Ridley, boot
and shoe maker.&nbsp; In the same Diary, date Monday, September
7th, 1778, he remarks: &ldquo;Mr Alderman Bull, of London, is
building a house on the Clift; a semicircular window is in each
story.&nbsp; Am told he meets with many obstacles in the
execution of his design.&mdash;Surely it is to the interest of
these people (meaning the inhabitants) to have such men become
resident among them; but he is denied a convenient entrance to
his building.&nbsp; A cellar window to the adjoining house
projects before his street door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Brighton at the present day possesses fine architectural
features cannot be denied.&nbsp; The magnificent Squares and
Crescents which flank its sea-frontage, and even form part of the
frontage, possess strong claims on our admiration, especially
when we glance at the general state and style of architecture of
our time, and reflect upon the rapid rise and development of the
town&mdash;looking to what it was and considering what it is.</p>
<p>During the close of the last, and the beginning of this
century, architecture had reached its lowest ebb in
England.&nbsp; Our true indigenous Gothic had almost passed into
a tradition: the Classic models, from their extreme
ill-adaptation to our climate, had undergone such deterioration,
that the application of the term even to the best of later works
was an absurdity.&nbsp; The influence of Sir Christopher Wren had
been of the most baneful character; not that he was himself
deficient in genius, but that his style, which hardly attains to
grandeur even in the Metropolitan Cathedral, was of a character
which inevitably degenerated in feeble hands.&nbsp; Thus it
happened that we were left almost without a national style, or,
at least with one utterly devoid of intrinsic merit of any
kind.&nbsp; The churches and other public buildings were erected
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>upon no
principles; and in accordance only with the taste, or want of
taste, in the architect, who no longer represented an Art, but
devoted himself to a Profession.</p>
<p>Of course, when all the higher and more important offices of
architecture were thus indifferently served, it was not to be
expected that street-architecture would fare very happily.&nbsp;
Our streets, in fact, gradually lost all their picturesqueness
and variety of the olden times, and gained neither dignity nor
beauty.&nbsp; Complacent builders shrugged their shoulders in
pity at ancestors who had covered houses with roofs like
over-sized wigs; or had recourse to hanging stories one
projecting over the other until the light of heaven only stole
into the streets through a narrow aperture above the road.&nbsp;
But though these things were quaint and barbarous, there was a
something about them which had in it the sense of
beauty,&mdash;something which makes one even now prefer the High
Street of Eastgrinstead to the latest built, the most elegant and
supernaturally genteel of our modern terraces.</p>
<p>This, however, has only just begun to be felt, and when
Brighton rose like a dream upon the remains of a fishing village,
none of these things were thought of.&nbsp; People had certainly
discernment enough to see that the rude village style would not
do.&nbsp; A visitor of Dr. Russell&rsquo;s time describes
Brighton houses as consisting of one or more stories, and with
the door-ways so low that you must stoop to enter, and then
probably stumble down a step or two into the sitting room.&nbsp;
A person has only to go into the Twittens, the narrow lanes
between Middle Street and Black Lion Street, to witness even now
such illustrations.&nbsp; The Railway booking office, in Castle
Square, is a specimen of the architecture of Brighton after this
period; and under George IV. it was beginning its marvellous
development.</p>
<p>This sort of thing it soon became necessary to alter, and year
after year saw the gradual improvement in the streets of the
town.&nbsp; But though this resulted in fine streets, and in
lofty and commodious houses, the element of beauty was always
wanting, simply because there was nothing like a principle in the
minds of builders.&nbsp; They had some vague notions of the
Palladian oracles, of a bastard Italian, a debased Renaissance,
applicable to dwelling-houses; but <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the results of the application were
and have been, up to the present time, deplorable.</p>
<p>Brighton is not alone in this matter,&mdash;indeed, it rises
superior to very many of its compeers; but when its position and
infinite diversity of sight are reflected upon, there cannot fail
to be regrets upon the Brighton it might have been.&nbsp;
Supposing, for example, that an earlier recognition of the claims
of Gothic and an English style had taken place.&nbsp; Suppose
that the public buildings, instead of being of the packing case
order in beauty&mdash;hollow cubes with a sham frontage of
stuccoed pilasters&mdash;had presented the variety in structure
and beauty in detail which is found in a minor degree in St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; Suppose further that the streets,
instead of having, as at present, flat, level surfaces, without a
line of beauty in themselves, without a curve or an angle to
reflect the sunshine or hold the shadow, which is so exquisite,
had retained even the quaintness of early times, what a town
Brighton would have been!&nbsp; No continental town could, from
its very situation and the formation of the ground upon which it
stands, have exceeded it in picturesque loveliness.&nbsp; And
short of this, even had the purer Italian models been followed,
had builders attempted such erections as those of Palmeira
Square, or those of the Pavilion Buildings,&mdash;and they are
the best specimens of that class of street architecture which we
possess,&mdash;the result would have been a grandeur and a beauty
which would have left the visitor no ground for a moment&rsquo;s
doubt that Brighton is indeed the &ldquo;Queen of Watering
Places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The improvement in the style of the buildings was the natural
result of the great accession of visitors for the benefit of the
sea-bathing.&nbsp; Bew remarks, Sunday, September 13th,
1778:&mdash;&ldquo;Took the liberty of surveying all the
bathing-machines.&nbsp; Fine ladies going,&mdash;fine ladies
coming away.&nbsp; Observe them at the instant of
bathing,&mdash;how humiliating!&nbsp; They appear more deplorable
than so many corpses in shrouds, and put me in mind of the old
dialogue between Death and the Lady.&nbsp; Methinks the guide is
saying, in the character of Death,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Fair lady, lay your costly robes aside,<br />
Nor longer think to glory in your pride.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An idea may be formed of the rage for bathing at this period
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>from an
entry of the same diarist, Thursday, September 9th,
1779:&mdash;&ldquo;Each man runs to a machine-ladder as it is
dragging out of the sea, and scuffles who shall first set foot
thereon: some send their footmen and contend by proxy; others go
in in boots, or on horseback to meet the machines:&mdash;so that
a tolerably modest man, on a busy morning, has generally an hour
and a half, perhaps two hours, for contemplation on the sands, to
the detriment of his shoes, as well as the diminution of his
patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on Saturday, the 11th of the same
month, he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Have matched the bathers and
bathees this trip however, having corrected them all
handsomely&mdash;without quarrelling&mdash;have given them the
slip; but take the particulars:&mdash;About 6 a.m., I drew along
the sands, the machine of which I had become seized by
prescriptive right, by legal possession, having deposited part of
my wearing apparel therein, tho&rsquo; I had requested the
assistance of the <i>marine centaur</i>, the man on horseback, in
vain.&nbsp; As the tide was flowing, I soon plunged into the sea,
stretched a long way out into the offing, and continued rolling
and laughing among my brother porpoises, to think what a loss the
company on shore would sustain for want of one machine out of
seven, it being a very fine busy morning.&nbsp; The bathers
holloa&rsquo;d and bawled in vain; for I could not, indeed would
not hear them.&nbsp; After swimming backwards and forwards along
the shore, about four miles in the whole, the tide setting strong
to the eastward all the time, I returned about nine; and Smoaker,
growling like a bear with a sore head, swore bitterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William (Smoaker) Miles was a great celebrity, being the
principal bathing man.&nbsp; One day, when the Prince of Wales
was bathing, he ventured out further than Old Smoaker considered
prudent.&nbsp; In vain Smoaker called &ldquo;Mr. Prince, Mr.
Prince, come back,&rdquo; his holloas only causing His Royal
Highness to dash out further.&nbsp; As the only means to exact
obedience, in rushed the old man, swam up to the Prince, and,
seizing him by the ear, lugged him, <i>nolens volens</i>, to the
shore.&nbsp; When his young aquatic student remonstrated upon
receiving such treatment, Old Smoaker rolled out a round oath or
two, adding, &ldquo;I ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t agoen&rsquo; to let the
king hang me for letten&rsquo; the Prince of Wales drown hisself;
not I, to please nobody, I can tell&rsquo;e.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
incident pleased the Prince, who ever <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>afterwards patronised him.&nbsp; To
testify, also, His Royal Highness&rsquo;s respect for the
straightforward, honest, but blunt fellow, he established the
Smoaker Stakes, which were run for at the Brighton Races, Friday,
July 25th, 1806, with the following result:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Smoaker Stakes of 20gs. each, one mile; 8 yr.
olds to carry 7st.&nbsp; 4 yr. olds 8st. 3lb.&nbsp; 5 yr. olds
8st. 9lb.&nbsp; 6 yr. olds 9st. 11lb., and aged 9st. 1lb.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Old Smoaker was a bit of a wit in his way.&nbsp; On one
occasion, while he was standing near the Ship in Distress Inn,
now the Sea House Hotel, two dandies of the day addressed him,
stating that they had come down to Brighton for the benefit of
their health, and had been recommended to drink asses&rsquo;
milk, could he inform them how it was to be obtained.&nbsp;
Miles, more plain than polite, replied that he did not then
exactly know, but he should advise them, for the sake of saving
themselves trouble, to suck each other.</p>
<p>William Miles was succeeded, as Royal Bather, by his brother
John, who, when too old to follow his occupation, was pensioned
off by Royalty, as long as he lived.&nbsp; A song of the time,
then very popular, ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s plenty of dippers and jokers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And salt-water rigs for your fun;<br />
The king of them all is &ldquo;Old Smoaker,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The queen of &rsquo;em, &ldquo;Old Martha
Gunn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies walk out in the morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To taste of the salt-water breeze;<br />
They ask if the water is warm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Says Martha, &ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then away to the machines they run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis surprising how soon they get stript;<br
/>
I oft wish myself Martha Gunn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to see the young ladies get dipt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martha Gunn had a world-wide fame, and was the cotemporary of
Mrs. Cobby, the original bather.&nbsp; Old Smoaker&rsquo;s
daughter was known as Martha&rsquo;s handmaiden, she being the
chief dipper with the &ldquo;Lady of the Bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>The
following extracts from the <i>Morning Herald</i> will give an
idea of the importance of Martha and her occupation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>July 15th, 1805.&mdash;The venerable Priestess of
the Bath, Martha Gunn, was busily employed this morning.</p>
<p>August 4th, 1806.&mdash;The bathing machines were in active
use this morning, and Neptune&rsquo;s <i>pickling tub</i>
exhibited many beauties in brine.</p>
<p>August 16th.&mdash;Many of our lovely belles took <i>ducks</i>
for their breakfast this morning, purchased of their cateress,
Martha Gunn, who boasts that from the fair profits she gains by
the sale of her <i>ducks</i>, she is often enabled to purchase a
goose for dinner.</p>
<p>August 28th.&mdash;The Beach this morning was thronged with
ladies, all anxious to make interest for a dip.&nbsp; The
machines, of course, were in very great request, though none
could be run into the ocean in consequence of the heavy swell,
but remained stationary at the water&rsquo;s edge, from which
Martha Gunn and her robust female assistants took their fair
charges, closely enveloped in their partly coloured dresses, and
gently held them to the breakers, which not quite so gently
passed over them.&nbsp; The greatest novelty, however, that this
part of the coast exhibited this morning, was in a
gentleman&rsquo;s undressing himself on the Beach, for the
purpose of a ducking, in front of the town, attended by his lady,
who <i>sans diffidence</i>, supplied him with napkins, and even
assisted him in wiping the humid effects of his exercise from his
brawny limbs, as he returned from the water to dress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following season the practice of bathing from the beach
became so general that on Thursday, August 19th, a Vestry Meeting
was held at the Old Ship, for the purpose of adopting measures to
prevent the indecent practice of indiscriminate bathing in front
of the town.&nbsp; Earl Bathurst and Mr. Wilberforce were
present, and subscribed five guineas each to defray any expenses
of prosecutions that might be deemed requisite to rid the town of
the evil.&nbsp; The resolutions passed, that proceedings should
be taken against offenders, for awhile had the desired effect;
but in 1808 the nuisance was revived, resulting in a prosecution
at the Horsham Assizes, on Monday, March 21st, 1809.&nbsp; The
case was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">The King</span> <i>v.</i>
<span class="smcap">John Crunden</span>.&mdash;The defendant was
indicted for indecently exposing himself on the beach at
Brighton, on the 26th of June, and 2nd of July last.</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney having opened the indictment, Mr. Serjeant Shepperd
stated the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; He observed, that it
had long been the practice of various persons to undress and
bathe so near to the houses, and within view of the inhabitants
of the town of Brighton, that at length many respectable persons
had associated themselves into a Committee, to prevent such an
indecent nuisance.&nbsp; They had accordingly met and pointed out
the limits within which persons not using machines might bathe in
the sea, and in general most persons acquiesced in <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>their
resolution.&nbsp; In order, however, that no person might
complain of any hardship, they resolved that all persons who were
invalids, and to whom it might be inconvenient to walk to the
distance prescribed, should have tickets given them on
application to the Committee, which would entitle them at any
time to the use of a bathing machine gratis.&nbsp; And still
further, to preserve public decency they had built a hut on the
beach, wherein any person might undress himself under
cover.&nbsp; Notwithstanding these different accommodations, the
defendant, who was a tailor, at Brighton, refused to conform to
these reasonable regulations, but obstinately persisted in the
indecent practice of bathing within a few yards of the
houses.&nbsp; He had been frequently remonstrated with, but his
uniform answer was, the <i>sea was free</i>, and he would bathe
when and where he pleased.&nbsp; Nor was he merely content in
doing this in his own person, but he had induced many others to
follow his example, and he constantly came at the head of his
companions, by whom he was denominated the Captain, and in
defiance of all decency and remonstrance, daily exposed himself
naked on the Beach.&nbsp; The Learned Serjeant here called
witnesses to prove the facts he had stated.</p>
<p>Mr. Marryatt addressed the jury for the defence, in which he
stated it had been the custom at all times for persons to bathe
where the defendant now bathed, and they ought not to be
disturbed because Mr. Ellis, the witness, had thought proper to
run up houses within view.</p>
<p>The Chief Baron thought this a serious question, and stated
his opinion that it was an offence against decency and
morality.&nbsp; If a town grew up, the inhabitants must not be
annoyed with indecent spectacles; and therefore it became the
duty of the bather to retire to remoter situations.&mdash;The
Jury found the defendant <i>Guilty</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For awhile this example had a very salutary effect; but, more
or less, until the present season, the nuisance has
continued.&nbsp; Now the New Bye Laws prohibit bathing from the
beach in front of the town, except before the hour of six in the
morning or after nine in the evening; and all persons bathing
from the machines are compelled to wear gowns, drawers, or some
such suitable covering.&nbsp; Less than thirty years since the
bathing from the Ladies&rsquo; Bathing Machines, between West
Street and Middle Street, was not of the most pleasant character,
as it was customary for coal brigs in fine weather, to discharge
their cargoes at that spot, and frequently, so was the surface of
the water covered with fine coal dust, that many a child who
dreaded bathing, was compelled to be dipped an extra time or two
by the bathing women, to rinse off the black particles.</p>
<p>Some years have elapsed since the universal practice prevailed
of discharging cargoes of coal, stone, timber, &amp;c., in front
of the town, greater facilities than formerly existed being
offered now, at Shoreham, for unloading at the wharfs, without
the risk of the vessels&mdash;as was very frequently the
case,&mdash;being stranded.&nbsp; Great quantities <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>of coal is
also transmitted to Brighton by rail from Deptford Creek, so that
that useful household commodity is much reduced in price to what
it formerly was.&nbsp; In the week prior to Christmas, 1812, such
was the scarcity of coal in the town, from adverse winds
prevailing and preventing the arrival of shipping from the north,
that persons in even comfortable circumstances, whose cellars
were exhausted, purchased only to the extent of a bushel at a
time, and so indifferent were the coal merchants to part with
their coal even at &pound;5 a chaldron&mdash;about equal to the
present ton,&mdash;that at the coal-yard of Messrs. Edmund Savage
and Bonham, which was situate opposite Ship Street Lane, in North
Street, immediately above the shop of Messrs. Palmer and Green,
ironmongers, the purchaser of half-a-bushel of coal was compelled
likewise to buy at the same time sixpenny worth of uncleft
wood.</p>
<p>The following will show the cost of coal per chaldron at that
period to the coal merchants in the town:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Newcastle on Tyne, the
Sixteenth day of November in the year of our Lord One Thousand
Eight Hundred and Thirteen.</p>
<p>It is this day mutually agreed between Mr. William Spence,
owner of the good ship or vessel, called the &ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo;
Wm. Hunter, master, of the burthen of 96 tons, or thereabouts,
now on her passage to Sunderland; and Messrs. Savage and Bonham,
of Brighton, merchants, freighters of the said ship, for one
voyage, at and from Sunderland to Brighton Beach.&nbsp; That the
said ship being tight, staunch, and strong, and every way fitted
for the voyage, the said master, with said ship, shall, with the
first opportunity, after arriving at Sunderland, take on board a
full and competent cargo of Nesham Main Coals.&nbsp; And being so
loaden, the said master, with said ship, shall therewith proceed
to Brighton Beach, or so near thereunto as he may safely get, and
deliver the same to the order of the said freighters, on being
paid freight, at the rate of Thirty-eight Shillings per chaldron,
Winchester measure; the freighters paying King&rsquo;s duty, Town
dues at Brighton, Ramsgate and Dover Harbour dues, and the owner
lights, metage, delivery, and pilotage, during said voyage.&nbsp;

whatever nature, fire, and enemies, always excepted.)&nbsp;
Freight to be paid on delivery by what cash wanted for
ship&rsquo;s use, and for the remainder a good Bill on London, at
two months&rsquo; date.&nbsp; Two days allowed said freighters
(if the ship is not sooner despatched), for unloading the said
ship at Brighton.&nbsp; Demurrage, Three Guineas per day, for
every day&rsquo;s detention, over and above the days allowed as

<p>The incidental expenses attendant upon freighting a vessel
brought the actual cost to &pound;3 16s. 3d. per chaldron, as

<p>Added to this, Mr. Savage, upon this occasion, to obtain the
cargo with the least possible delay, made a journey to Newcastle,
the expenses of which amounted to &pound;20.</p>
<p>In 1805, persons interested in shipping, the coal merchants
especially, entertained the idea of a basin or harbour for the
safety and accommodation of vessels trading hither.&nbsp; The
project did not meet with approval amongst the inhabitants
generally, as they were desirous of retaining the town as a place
of fashionable resort, rather than make it a trading port; and in
April, the following year, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
having caused it to be signified through Mr. Thomas Saunders,
High Constable, that he had not bestowed his sanction or
patronage in favour of the project, and that he did not intend to
possess any such intention, the idea was abandoned.&nbsp; Some of
those, however, interested in the scheme, bore their
disappointment with but an ill grace, and for some years after
the payment of the coal duties was the source of much
disaffection.&nbsp; The principal of those who combatted against
the payment was Mr. William Izard, whose reasons of objection
were embodied in a handbill which he issued, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>To the Vistors and
Inhabitants of the Town of Brighthelmston</i>, <i>and to all such
other persons as it may concern</i>.</p>
<p>Whereas sundry reports and misrepresentations have been
propagated, and widely circulated concerning myself, in
consequence of my having lately refused to pay the Coal Duty of
three shillings per chaldron on all coals landed (<i>from my own
vessels</i>) at this place, for the use and consumption of the
inhabitants, as heretofore levied by the Commissioners acting
under the Town Act, for the express purpose of &ldquo;Building
and repairing Groyns, Sea Walls, and other works, for the
protection of the town of Brighthelmston against the encroachment
of the sea, pursuant to the powers and by virtue of and by the
authority of an Act of <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Parliament made and passed in the
50th year of his present Majesty,&rdquo; for the before-named
purposes;</p>
<p>In vindication of my own conduct, and in strict justice to
myself and family, and that the public may not form an opinion
which may in any wise operate to my prejudice, I do hereby beg
leave to state my several objections for so refusing to pay the
said Coal Duties, so unwarrantably demanded, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First</span>.&mdash;Because it clearly
appears to me, from the best account that I have been able to
obtain from Mr. T. Attree, the Commissioners&rsquo; Clerk and
Treasurer, that since the passing of the aforesaid Act of
Parliament and the levying of the said Coal Duties, that the
Commissioners have actually been in the receipt of near Eight
Thousand Pounds from that source only!</p>
<p>And that it also appears that the said Commissioners have not
expended <i>Three Thousand Pounds</i> of such monies so received,
for the protection of the town, agreeable to the express
provisions and in strict conformity to such enactments as are set
forth in the said Act of Parliament; so that it seems that there
is now a balance of between four and five thousand pounds in
favour of that particular and specific account, and which balance
of Surplus Duties now remains unapplied towards those sacred
purposes for which it was raised, by and under the authority of
the aforesaid Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding the immense balance in favour of the
Groyns just before stated, and irreconcilable and incongruous as
it may appear, these very same Commissioners are now actually
paying the interest on the sum of &pound;1140 money borrowed on
the credit of the said Coal Duties, and that, in direct
opposition to the very terms of the aforesaid Act of Parliament,
which strictly restrains Commissioners from applying any money
arising from that branch of their finance to any other use or
purpose whatever, whilst there shall be any money due or be owing
upon the credit of that account.</p>
<p>And yet under all these circumstances the Commissioners are
still endeavouring to increase their balance of Coal Duties,
although it is not wanted for the purpose for which it is levied;
and were the Commissioners to convert such balance to any other
use, it would in them constitute a great abuse of power, and a
high breach of their trust!</p>
<p>As I do not chuse to participate in either of these crimes, I
am unwilling to increase the guilt of such a portion of the
Commissioners as may chuse to indulge in such gross misconduct,
by continuing to do that to my own wrong, which would ultimately
increase theirs.</p>
<p>It is upon these grounds and upon them only, that I have been
induced to refuse the payment of Groyn Dues; and I must also beg
it to be unequivocally understood, that when the before-named
balance of between Four and Five Thousand Pounds shall have been
legally and fairly expended and properly accounted for, and if
circumstances should hereafter make it necessary, I shall most
willingly and cheerfully submit to the payment of the Coal Duty
as heretofore.</p>
<p>Brighton, August 24th, 1814.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Wm.
Izard</span>.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the above address, Mr. Wm. Gates,
principal Coast Officer of the Customs at this place, and the
Commissioners&rsquo; Collector of Groyn Dues, assisted by Mr. T.
Attree, their Clerk and Treasurer, accompanied by the Brighton
Magistrates, and also by Mr. Robert Ackerson, the present High
Constable, and a great possy of &ldquo;Headboroughs&rdquo; and
other persons have thought proper to make a seizure in my Coal
Yard of Eight Chaldron of Coals, to <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>satisfy themselves for the payment
of such Dues as they pretend to claim as due from myself: to
effect which, the violent measure of breaking open my Coal Yard
gate, by forcing the lock, was resorted to, on Thursday last; but
as the merits of this transaction are put into a fair train of
legal investigation, I have to request that the candid public
will be pleased to suspend judgment till the issue shall be so
determined.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Wm.
Izard</span>,<br />
Ship Owner and Coal Merchant.</p>
<p>Brighton, August 29, 1814.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The power of the authorities prevailed, and the Dues continued
to be exacted.</p>
<p>The female attendants of the machines are, as respects dress
especially, of the primitive order of their race, except that
they do not in the afternoon appear in their best prim attire, as
of yore they were wont to do, to &ldquo;tout&rdquo; in Castle
Square, on the arrival of the coaches.&nbsp; Their last grand
show day in their aquatic costume was on the occasion of their
visit to the Exhibition, in Hyde Park, 1851, when, to defray
their expenses, subscriptions were raised amongst the
inhabitants.&nbsp; At the Exhibition they were the observed of
all observers; and had but the original idea been carried out of
their travelling from the London Bridge Terminus to the building,
in their machines, the arrangements of the day would have been
complete, and the unsightliness and primitive construction of the
vehicles would have excited the sympathy of some inventor and
induced him to bring out something that would have had a
creditable appearance.</p>
<p>Almost coeval with sea-bathing in establishing the reputation
of Brighton, were the baths, first established by Dr. Awsiter, on
the spot now occupied by Brill&rsquo;s Ladies&rsquo; Swimming
Bath, and for so many years known as Wood&rsquo;s Original Hot
and Cold Sea-water Baths.&nbsp; The first stone of these baths,
which were after a plan of Mr. Golden, architect, was laid in the
year 1759.&nbsp; Mr. George Lynn erected the present
building.</p>
<p>Dr. Awsiter, in a pamphlet, called &ldquo;Thoughts on
Brighthelmston,&rdquo; published in 1768, says, &ldquo;The
utility of these baths is obvious: they may be used either for
hot or cold bathing.&nbsp; There are some individuals to whom
cold bathing would be serviceable, could they be able to bear the
fatigue of being dipt in the sea, and (what is more material), to
be exposed to the cold air.&nbsp; If the <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>weather
happens to be stormy, and the sea so rough, as not to admit of
bathing in it, recourse may be had to the baths: by this means
bathing would become more universal, be unattended with terror,
and no cure protracted.&nbsp; Moreover, invalids would have the
advantage of this bathing remedy all the year round; whereas, on
account of the variableness of our climate, it is denied them at
present, except in the Summer months, and then only in calm
weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Artillery Baths, the next established, obtained their
original fame from the proprietor, Mr. Smith, having discovered a
method of curing the gout, by means of an air pump, from whence
many persons of rank and consequence received great
benefit.&nbsp; They are known now as Hobden&rsquo;s Artillery
Baths.</p>
<p>Williams&rsquo;s Hot and Cold Baths, which occupied the site
of the present Lion Mansion, at one period received extensive
patronage, and the <i>Morning Herald</i> of August 17, 1807,
says, &ldquo;Williams&rsquo;s Baths are in very fashionable
request.&nbsp; Numberless <i>elegantes</i> were in hot water
there this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; On Mr. Williams&rsquo;s decease
they were carried on by Mr. Bannister, who was succeeded by his
son-in-law, Mr. William Knight.&nbsp; The halcyon days, however,
of these baths had fled, and the premises, after remaining in a
very dilapidated state for some time, were cleared off for the
erection of the present noble mansion.</p>
<p>The personage who acquired the greatest fame for his baths,
and obtained the highest and most extensive patronage, was Sake
Deen Mahomed, who, although not born in Brighton, yet, this
highly favoured town was the theatre where his name became patent
for the alleviation of suffering mankind, and hence he is
entitled to special notice.</p>
<p>He was a native of India, and was born at Patna, the capital
of Bahar, about 290 miles N.W. of Calcutta, in the year
1749.&nbsp; Having been educated for the surgical profession, he
entered the East India Company&rsquo;s service in that capacity,
which he afterwards relinquished, and for fifteen years acted
exclusively in a military character.&nbsp; In the year 1780 he
was appointed by Major, afterwards General Popham, to a company,
but in 1784, he left the service and came to England, where be
continued to reside the <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>remainder of his valuable
life.&nbsp; In his early days having devoted much time and
attention to Oriental bathing, both medicinally and as a luxury,
on his arrival in England, he was induced to think seriously of
introducing the Indian Vapour Bath, and the art of Shampooing,
and sedulously employed himself in preliminary experiments, to
prove the correctness of the hypothesis he had formed, that what
was a luxurious restorative in India, might prove in England a
wonderful remedy for many diseases.</p>
<p>Justified by proof, he repaired to Brighton, where he
promulgated his discovery, but at first with little success, as
the public were ill-prepared to receive a system which should
supercede Warm Sea-water Bathing.&nbsp; Fortunately, however, he
effected several gratuitous cures,&mdash;cures which quickly
gained circulation amongst those who had prejudged and condemned
his bath; and adduced the most positive and convincing proof of
the great superiority of Shampooing over every other description
of treatment, in particular cases.&nbsp; All prejudices were
quickly removed, and his wide-spread fame soon gained him the
appointment of Shampooing Surgeon to their Majesties George IV.
and William IV.&nbsp; Presents, conveying the expressions of the
deepest feelings of gratitude and thankfulness, crowded upon
him.&nbsp; The Muses poured forth their eulogiums; the several
organs of the press&mdash;national and local&mdash;their
panegyrics.</p>
<p>He exemplified the curative and invigorating influence of his
Art in his person and his longevity.&nbsp; He died the 24th of
February, 1851, at the advanced age of 102 years, and was buried
in the church-yard of St. Nicholas, Brighton, where an unassuming
tomb records his age and death.&nbsp; He was father of Mr.
Frederick Mahomed, of the Gymnasium, Palace Place.</p>
<p>Mahomed&rsquo;s Bath establishment opposite the Star and
Garter Hotel, King&rsquo;s Road, is now the property of Mr.
Charles Brill, who is likewise the proprietor of the
Ladies&rsquo; Swimming Bath, before mentioned, and the extensive
baths and the Gentlemen&rsquo;s Swimming Bath, originally
Lamprell&rsquo;s, at the bottom of East Street.&nbsp;
Buggins&rsquo;s Baths in Western Street, are a great acquisition
to the western part of the town; where also, in the Western Road,
Hove, is the Turkish Bath of Dr. Toulmin, who is well supported
in his popular <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>treatment.&nbsp; Other baths have from time to time
been started, mostly, however, with a very ephemeral
existence.</p>
<p>Great as was the success of Mahomed&rsquo;s process, he was in
no inconsiderable degree indebted for the many cures he effected
to the perseverance of Mr. Henry Harrap, to whose memory the
author of this book has a grateful respect, for enabling him to
retain and ably use a leg, the amputation of which had been
recommended by the faculty.&nbsp; Little is known of his early
career, more than that he was born at Helston, in Cornwall,
October 21st, 1794.&nbsp; He left home at an early age, and
during the short peace previous to the battle of Waterloo, he was
a private in the 51st Foot, the Duke of York&rsquo;s Own.&nbsp;
In 1817, he was with his regiment stationed at the Infantry
Barracks, Brighton, being then an officer&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp;
His brother Richard was also in the same regiment, as
Sergeant-Bugler, and, during his location here, he married, at
Preston, a young woman, the widow of Corporal Fudge, late of the
Gloucester Militia.&nbsp; But shortly after his marriage he
deserted.&nbsp; His wife however, provided two substitutes, and
paid &pound;40 for his discharge; she also bought Henry off, and
the two brothers, till the year 1828, followed the trade of boot
and shoe making, in Ivory Place.&nbsp; The maiden name of his
wife was Short, a native of the village of Hangleton, and she was
married to Fudge before she was 14 years of age, in consequence
of her mother, who was a widow, being about to be married to
another corporal in the same regiment, the man refusing to wed
her with an incumbrance.&nbsp; Richard died in 1828, and in the
following year Henry was married to his brother&rsquo;s widow, at
St. George&rsquo;s in the Borough, London.&nbsp; By neither
brother had she any family; but by her first husband she had four
daughters.&nbsp; She died in July, 1843.&nbsp; In 1838, Mr.
Harrap discontinued the business of shoemaking, and converted the
shop-front of his premises on the Grand Parade, at the corner of
Sussex Street, to one of a more private character, devoting the
whole of his attention to professional rubbing.</p>
<p>At the zenith of the career of Sake Deen Mahomed, Mr. Harrap
obtained the custom of that professor, and for a long time
continued to make and repair shoes for the family.&nbsp; This
circumstance caused him frequently to visit Mr. Mahomed&rsquo;s
establishment, where he <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>principally obtained that
information which enabled him to commence the practice of
rubbing, omitting the shampooing process, his inventive genius
enabling him to substitute as many contrivances as the numerous
cases of affliction entrusted to his skill and care
required.&nbsp; Many of his inventions, which had been of benefit
to sufferers, formed a species of Museum in a room at
Mahomed&rsquo;s establishment.&nbsp; From Mrs. Williams, too, a
neighbour, in Ivory Place, who was celebrated for her healing
unguents, Mr. Harrap gained much of his surgical knowledge.</p>
<p>Mr. Harrap was totally uneducated, and, at the commencement of
his professional career, entirely unacquainted with medical
science and nomenclature; yet, progressively, by natural instinct
as it were, and studied practice, he acquired a knowledge of
anatomy which astonished those who were conversant with that
science; and gentlemen of high position in the medical
profession&mdash;including the late Sir Matthew Tierney, Sir
Astley Cooper, Sir Benjamin Brodie, &amp;c.,&mdash;acknowledged
his worth by awarding him that credit which they considered due
to an energetic and gifted man.&nbsp; His perseverance enabled
him to amass a large fortune; and after having been a great
sufferer for more than two years, from a cancer of the bowels, he
was removed by death from the scene of a most useful life, on
Saturday, the 12th of October of last year, leaving a wife, the
widow of the late Sidney Walsingham Bennett, Esq., solicitor, to
lament her irreparable bereavement, and a large circle of
grateful patients and sincere friends the remembrance of an
honourable, and honoured man.</p>
<p>For some time previous to his decease he had been unable to
attend actively to his professional duties; yet, he was present
daily, at his house of business on the Grand parade, watching,
and instructing his step-son, now his successor, Mr. Sidney
Bennett, who qualified as a surgeon on the 29th of May, 1861, and
there is little doubt his perseverance in the course pursued by
the deceased will add a lustre to his father-in-law&rsquo;s name,
and confirm a credit due to the memory of a man who was never
ambitious of praise, but perseveringly sought a remedy to
alleviate the sufferings of the afflicted.&nbsp; Deceased was
buried at the Parochial Cemetery, Lewes Road.</p>

239</span>Nature has been peculiarly bountiful in her goodness
towards Brighton; as, independent of the salubrity of the
position of the town and the superlative excellence of its
sea-water, the Chalybeate spring at the Wick is possessed of
great curative properties, the opinion of Drs.&nbsp; Russell and
Relhan, being confirmed by Dr. Henderson, who thus
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This water, when first taken from the spring in a
glass, in appearance greatly resembles a solution of emetic
tartar in common water.&nbsp; The taste is not unpleasant,
something like that upon a knife after it has been used in
cutting lemons.&nbsp; It does not seem to contain the smallest
portion of sulphur; it neither changes vegetable blues, red, nor
does it effervesce with alkaline salts, calcareous earths,
magnesia, nor fossil alkali; neither does it change vegetable
blues, green, nor does it effervesce with acids; yet it curdles
soap, and renders a solution of it in various spirits milky.</p>
<p>It seems to contain a considerable portion of calcareous
earth, mixed with vitriolic acid in the form of its selenites,
and also a considerable portion of iron, as will appear from the
following experiment: Sixty-four ounces of this water by measure
being evaporated to dryness, there was a residuum of a brownish
colour, full of spicul&aelig;, weighing eight grains, four ounces
of which, with an equal quantity of charcoal, was made into a
paste with oil, and calcined.&nbsp; On trying the calcined matter
with the magnet, two pieces nearly in the metallic form adhered
to it; and when put upon paper, at the distance of half an inch,
moved in every direction with the magnet.&nbsp; These two pieces
weighed one-eighth of a grain.</p>
<p>The gross residuum neither effervesces with alkali nor acids,
and is sufficiently soluble in water.</p>
<p>This water becomes instantly transparent, like distilled
water, on the addition of any of the mineral acids, especially
the vitriolic.</p>
<p>A solution of galls in common water, added to an equal portion
of this water, becomes black like ink, in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The Chalybeate has been found serviceable in several cases of
general debility, crapulas, indigestion, atony of the stomach,
and fluor albus; and in all those diseases where chalybeate and
tonic remedies are required, it promises, under due regulation,
to be useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Henderson was a physician of eminence in the town; and a
minute of Vestry, at the Unicorn Inn, February 10th, 1794, shews
the esteem in which he was held by the inhabitants.&nbsp; It runs
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Dr. Henderson presented with a pint silver
cup, for his care and attention to the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A character of the time, who also practised the healing art,
is not so favourably mentioned in the Vestry Book, February 4th,
1805, the entry of him being:&mdash;&ldquo;Resolved that Michael
Cobby be allowed eight shillings per week, on his quitting the
Poor-house; and his <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>drugs and effects delivered up to
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must not, from this, however, be supposed
medicine and surgery were so at a discount that parish relief was
requisite to maintain</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The wise physician
skilled our wounds to heal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Cobby, as he was familiarly known, had talent, but he was
more a disciple of Bacchus, than of Galen, and the natural reply
to him, as he tendered his services in his tattered clothes,
which his poverty bespake, and as a foul specimen of the
unwashed, would be &ldquo;Physician,
heal&mdash;cleanse&mdash;thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that Brighton
at that period had waned in the least from the character it had
obtained for healthfulness, as a memorandum, made August, 1806,
states:&mdash;&ldquo;Such is the healthy condition of the town,
that the doctors and apothecaries complain dolefully of their
declining businesses, and undertakers are literally starved out,
the latter declaring, &lsquo;All trades must live,&rsquo; but the
residents are determined not to serve them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1580,
there was but one medical man in Brighton, Dr. Mathews, who lived
in Middle street.&nbsp; His terms for attending in confinements
were: At Portslade and Rottingdean, 5s; at Blatchington, 3s 6d;
and anywhere in the town of Brighthelmston, 2s 6d.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1886, a sad scourge, the small pox,
pervaded the town, and on the 25th of January, that year, when
the population amounted to 3620, the following return of its
virulence was made:&mdash;</p>

<p>A general inoculation in consequence, was ordered at a Vestry
Meeting; and the 1887 who escaped the disease were inoculated by

health-providing town, is the German Spa, Queen&rsquo;s Park, an
establishment for manufacturing the Artificial Mineral Waters,
which, by the faculty, are pronounced to be so perfect an
imitation of the original springs in Germany, that the most
celebrated chemists can detect no difference between them.&nbsp;
They are the production of Dr. Struve, of Dresden, who some years
ago turned his attention to the analysis and imitation of the
original, and patients who have drank both can discover no
difference in their flavour or effect.&nbsp; The artificial

<p>Mr. G. S. Carey, in a &ldquo;Poetical Tagg, or Brighthelmstone
Guide,&rdquo; <a name="citation241"></a><a href="#footnote241"
class="citation">[241]</a> July 28th, 1777, gives the following
on the rise and progress of the town even at that
date:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This town, or village of renown,<br />
Like London Bridge, half broken down,<br />
Few years ago was worse than Wapping,<br />
Not fit for human soul to stop in;<br />
But now, like to a worn-out shoe,<br />
By patching well, the place will do.<br />
You&rsquo;d wonder much, I&rsquo;m sure, to see,<br />
How it&rsquo;s becramm&rsquo;d with quality;<br />
Here Lords and Ladies oft carouse<br />
Together in a tiny house;<br />
Like Joan and Darby in their cot,<br />
With stool and table, spit and pot;<br />
And what his valet would despise,<br />
<a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>His
lordship praises to the skies;<br />
But such the <i>ton</i> is, such the case,<br />
You&rsquo;ll see the first of rank or place,<br />
With star and riband, all profuse,<br />
Duck at his door-way like a goose:<br />
The humble beam was plac&rsquo;d so low,<br />
Perhaps to teach some clown to bow.<br />
The air is pure as pure can be,<br />
And such an aspect of the sea!<br />
As you, perhaps, ne&rsquo;er saw before,<br />
From off the side of any shore:<br />
On one hand Ceres spreads her plain,<br />
And on the other, o&rsquo;er the main,<br />
Many a bark majestic laves<br />
Upon the salt and buoyant waves;<br />
The hills all mantl&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er with green,<br />
A friendly shelter to the Steyne,<br />
Whene&rsquo;er the rugged Boreas blows,<br />
Bemingled with unwelcome snows:<br />
Such is the place and situation,<br />
Such is the reigning seat of fashion.</p>
<p>Brighthelmstone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 28th, 1777.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four years previous to the date of this &ldquo;Tag,&rdquo;
namely, in 1773, an Act of Parliament was passed, giving power to
sixty-four Commissioners, elected by the inhabitants, to light
and cleanse the streets, lanes, and other places within the town
of Brighton, and for the general regulation and improvement of
the town.&nbsp; In 1809, meetings of the inhabitants took place
at the Old Ship, for and in opposition to obtaining a new Act of
Parliament; and on the 21st of February, 1810, a very large
majority of the Vestry, at a meeting held at the Old Ship,
resolved that the Bill as framed by the Town Committee, which had
been appointed by the inhabitants, should be forthwith presented
to Parliament, to be passed into a law.&nbsp; The Act passed that
year, augmenting the number of Commissioners to one hundred, and
raising the duty on coal from sixpence to three shillings per
chaldron.&nbsp; On the 22nd of June, 1825, (6 Geo. IV.) this Act
was repealed and another passed, extending the number of
Commissioners to one hundred and twelve, and giving them
increased powers, in consequence of the extensive enlargement and
requirements of the town.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of this Act some of the greatest
improvements in the town were effected.&nbsp; The most prominent
of these was <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>the Sea Wall, which forms the southern front of
Brighton from Cannon Place to the west end of Kemp Town.&nbsp; As
early as 1799 the requirement of a wall at the foot of the East
Cliff, now the Marine Parade, to prevent the encroachments of the
sea, occupied the attention of the possessors of property in that
vicinity, as amongst the Conditions of Sale of the land for the
purpose of erecting the Royal Crescent,&mdash;sold by auction by
Mr. Christie, at the Old Ship Inn, Monday, September 16th,
1799,&mdash;was the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>If it shall be judged necessary to build a
Sea-Wall under the Cliff, for Use or Ornament, the Purchasers and
Plot Holders of each Ground Plot to contribute their Proportion
for Building the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The building of the Crescent commenced forthwith; but, in
consequence of one of the most prominent of the speculators
absconding, the whole of the houses were not completed until the
end of December, 1807, at which period the area in front of the
Crescent measured four acres.&nbsp; No wall was then considered
necessary at the foot of the Cliff, but a dwarf wall was built on
the south side of the carriage road, in lieu of posts and rails,
which guarded in a most irregular manner the other portion of the
road-way from the Steine to Black-Rock.&nbsp; On widening the
road as now existing in consequence of the construction of the
present massive sea-wall, not only was the dwarf wall removed but
the crown of the rise of the road, which there ranged with the
present paving of the Crescent, was taken off, and the incline
made on the turfed area, which was considerably contracted by
setting back the iron railings in a line with the front of the
other property immediately east and west.</p>
<p>A statue of the Prince of Wales, by Rossi, seven feet high, on
an ornamented pedestal, eleven feet high, was, in 1802, placed in
front of the Royal Crescent.&nbsp; His Royal Highness was
represented as dressed in his regimental uniform, with his arm
extended towards the sea.&nbsp; The statue, which was made of
plaster, cost upwards of &pound;300.&nbsp; In November, 1807,
some person broke off the fingers of the extended left
hand.&nbsp; Eventually the other arm with a portion of his mantle
was knocked away, and in that condition the mutilated figure was
allowed to remain several years, till <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>becoming more and more unsightly
from parties continually adding to its disfigurement, it was
removed.</p>
<p>Two incidents of a most melancholy character, in connexion
with the Royal Crescent, claim a record.&nbsp; The first was the
death of a workman, named Leggatt.&nbsp; He was engaged in
forming the words &ldquo;Royal Crescent&rdquo; on the tablet
which surmounts the centre house, and had finished the S, when,
on stepping back to observe its agreement with the other letters,
he over-balanced himself, and, falling upon the iron railings
below, he was unfortunately killed.&nbsp; The other event was the
death of a soldier, named Charles Millegan, of the Second
Battalion of the Coldstream Guards, which occurred on Christmas
night, 1835, he having accidentally fallen down the Cliff from
the Crescent wall.&nbsp; A stone to his memory, erected by the
privates of his battalion, in the north burial ground of St.
Nicholas Church, has the following inscription as a tribute of
respect by his comrades:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oft may the tear his green sod steep,<br />
And sacred be the Soldier&rsquo;s sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till time shall cease to run.<br
/>
And ne&rsquo;er beside his lonely grave<br />
May Briton&rsquo;s pass and fail to crave<br />
A blessing on the fallen brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such was <span
class="smcap">Millegan</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first section of the town Sea-Wall, that between Ship
street and Mahomed&rsquo;s&mdash;now Brill&rsquo;s
Baths,&mdash;was constructed in 1825.&nbsp; Then followed the
execution of the difficult enterprise, the union of the east and
west sea-drives and promenade, by the formation of the Junction
Road round Brill&rsquo;s Swimming Bath, and thence across the
outlet of the Pool Valley, and southing the Albion Hotel.&nbsp;
To effect this great undertaking, the sea had to be repelled,
hence recourse was had to the erection of a series of large
groynes, and the facing of the wall, which is of concrete&mdash;a
due admixture of grey lime and shingle,&mdash;with piles and
planking; and this proceeding resulted in the sea being forced
against the cliffs beyond the Chain Pier, storm after storm
making such inroads that in some places the Marine Parade was not
of sufficient width for a vehicle to pass.&nbsp; The proprietors
of houses along the Marine Parade, in consequence, became alarmed
for their property.&nbsp; The Commissioners therefore, took
immediate steps to prevent the incursions of the <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>ocean, and
numerous groynes, which were erected between the Chain Pier and
the Black-Rock groyne, having in some measure answered the
purpose of keeping back the raging water, a plan was attempted to
be carried out of forming a battering or leaning wall of flint as
a facing to the cliff, which was widened and filled in as the
wall progressed.&nbsp; The scheme, however, proved a fallacy; as
the amazing mass of unsettled earth with which it was backed up,
having become saturated with heavy rains, forced out the foot of
the wall, the whole of which slid out into the sea, or on the
beach.</p>
<p>A concrete wall of amazing substance, was then substituted
with the greatest success, at a cost of &pound;100,000, under
contracts, by Mr. William Lambert, an extensive builder of the
town.&nbsp; In many parts, the wall&mdash;which is in some places
sixty feet high,&mdash;is twenty-three feet thick at its base,
and batters&mdash;inclines&mdash;on an average, four inches to
the foot on the face.&nbsp; More recently, other portions of the
sea-front of the town have been extended in width, by the same
process, to admit of the increased road traffic, so that Brighton
may now boast of an uninterrupted sea-drive and promenade of more
than three miles&rsquo; extent.</p>
<p>The other public structures erected by the Commissioners are
the Market and the Town Hall.&nbsp; The former is a lofty and
commodious building, standing principally on the site of the Old
Workhouse and Town Hall.&nbsp; It is T shaped, with the
transverse head towards the east, opposite the Town Hall, a
building which occupies the space whereon, till the erection of
the new structure, the Market formerly stood.&nbsp; The corner
stone of the Town Hall was laid in April, 1830, by Thomas Read
Kemp, Esq., the contractor for the building being Mr. Doubleday,
whose tender was &pound;12,491 1s. 7d.&nbsp; The cost, however,
of the building, from the various hewings, hackings, and
cuttings, which it has undergone, has exceeded, at a moderate
calculation, &pound;60,000.&nbsp; It is after the plan of Mr.
Thomas Cooper, but it is minus a most important wing.&nbsp; This
defect arose from the Commissioners omitting to purchase land for
the south portion, the owner of the property refusing to sell
after the building had pretty far advanced.&nbsp; The consequence
is that the approaches to the upper rooms of the southern portion
are wanting, and hence much inconvenience is experienced.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>The
Town Hall is used for town meetings, public assemblies, the
Council meetings, and the general purposes of the Borough.&nbsp;
In it are offices for the Town Clerk&mdash;C. Sharood,
Esq.,&mdash;and his staff, for the Collectors of the Municipal
and Parish Rates, and for the Borough Surveyor&mdash;Mr. Philip
Lockwood,&mdash;and his staff.&nbsp; The Magistrates&rsquo;
Court, which occupies the southern basement, is likewise used for
the Borough Quarter Sessions, the Recorder being John Locke,
Esq., Q.C., and M.P. for Southwark.&nbsp; The police-force
originally established on the 15th of April, 1830, under
Chief-Officer Pilbeam,&mdash;the Police Station then being in
Steine Lane,&mdash;has at present Mr. George White for the
Chief-Constable, he having succeeded Mr. Chase on the 21st of
December, 1853, his predecessor,&mdash;who succeeded Mr.
Pilbeam,&mdash;Mr. Henry Solomon, having been murdered by John
Lawrence, on the 13th of March, 1844.&nbsp; The Superintendents
are Mr. Owen Crowhurst and Mr. Isaiah Barnden; and the Inspector
of Flys, &amp;c., is Mr. James Terry.&nbsp; The force consists of
80 men,&mdash;inspectors, sergeants, and privates,&mdash;who
occupy the south-west portion of the basement, immediately
contiguous to the Magistrates&rsquo; Court, the dungeons for the
uncommitted and, perhaps, innocent, being in the most remote
portion of the underground vaults at the north-east of the
building.</p>
<p>Prior to the establishment of the Police-force the care of the
town was entrusted to a few Watchmen of the antique school, by
night, and a Beadle in cocked-hat and general suit of his order,
by day, assisted by the Town Crier of similar mien and
garb.&nbsp; The Watchmen had succeeded the Patrol, a species of
self-guardianship which the inhabitants imposed upon themselves
in rotation, under the supervision of the High Constable and his
Headboroughs.&nbsp; During the Winter months it was also
customary for a bell-man to perambulate nightly most of the old
streets of the town, and hourly proclaim the time and
weather.&nbsp; The stocks in the Market place, and the parish
pound at the back of the Old Church were then in vogue.</p>
<p>A portion of the principal room on the basement, to form the
County Court, is temporarily taken off by means of a partition,
in two sections which swing back on hinges to the side
walls.&nbsp; The Court is held every alternate Friday, William
Furner, Esq., being <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>the Judge.&nbsp; The only residents
of the building are Friend Paine&mdash;the Hall-Keeper,&mdash;and
his wife.&nbsp; Paine, at one time, was in himself the fire
brigade of Brighton.&nbsp; Eight men, whose peculiarity of
costume for the office consisted in wearing white hats, had
previously been engaged to work the engines in the event of any
fires; but none occurring, the white-hatted force was dispensed
with, and eventually such an arrangement was made by the Town
Council with the Brighton, Hove, and Preston Constant Service
Water Company, that the fire-hose being fitted to plugs and
standards in connexion with the water-mains, the service of the
fire-engines was dispensed with, the position of the reservoir of
the Company, on the Race Hill, giving a pressure sufficiently
strong to force the water over the highest edifices in the
town.&nbsp; In 1825, a Sussex County and General Fire and Life
Assurance Company was projected, with Mr. Barnard Gregory as
Managing Director.&nbsp; The office of this Company was on the
premises in North Street now well known as Folthorp&rsquo;s Royal
Library, where, in front of the house, a fire-engine,
fire-escape, and other appropriate apparatus, were prominently
displayed.&nbsp; Firemen, bedight in the antique fittings of
their order in London, with silver-plated badge on their arms,
bearing the Brighton Arms,&mdash;two dolphins,&mdash;surmounted
with SVX, and encircled with &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Brighthelmston in sigilvm</span>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sussex County and General Fire and
Life Assurance Company</span>,&rdquo; perpetually showed
themselves about the premises which had been previously used as
the Mess House of the officers of regiments from time to time
stationed at the Infantry Barracks, Church Street.&nbsp; The
career of the Company was very brief, and the exploits of the
firemen were confined to one fire only, namely, that at Major
Russell&rsquo;s mansion, Portland Place, September 12th, 1825,
known in Brighton,&mdash;where the great rage for building had
then just set in,&mdash;as the year of the panic.&nbsp; Kemp Town
at that period, and for some few years afterwards, was a town of
carcasses, many of the houses being not only floorless and
windowless, but roofless.</p>
<p>In this district, but in the parish of Rottingdean,&mdash;to
avoid the Brighton coal dues,&mdash;the Brighton Old Gas Light
and Coke Company erected their works in 1818&ndash;19, much to
the dissatisfaction of the inhabitants, who petitioned Parliament
on the 6th of May, 1818, <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>against the introduction of gas into
the town.&nbsp; Some considerable time elapsed before it was much
used for in-door lighting, persons, in general, having a fear of
explosions.&nbsp; For illuminating it was first used on the 12th
of August, 1819, when, to oblige the Company, Mr. Stone,
shoemaker to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, gave them
permission to fit up, at their own expense, over his shop in East
Street, at the corner of Steine Lane, a design&mdash;the Prince
of Wales&rsquo; Feathers,&mdash;in gas, the effect of which
excited the wonder and admiration of the whole town, and
completely reconciled the inhabitants to the use of gas.</p>
<p>As early as 1806 the Incorporation of the town was mooted, and
on the 2nd of July, that year, a meeting of the inhabitants, at
which the Vicar, the Rev. R. Carr, presided, took place at the
Old Ship, respecting a communication which had been made from the
Prince of Wales to Sir Henry Rycroft, on the subject.&nbsp; The
meeting was numerously and respectably attended, and the subject
was ably and dispassionately discussed.&nbsp; After a debate of
several hours, the Incorporation by Charter was unanimously
negatived, and an address of thanks was voted to His Royal
Highness for his condescension, and the kind interest which he
took in the welfare of the inhabitants of the town.&nbsp; During
the meeting it was announced that the Prince had no particular
desire that the Incorporation by Charter should be adopted,
unless the inhabitants should conceive that such a measure would
promote their interests; and that any other mode which they might
better approve of, for the impartial administration of justice in
the place, should be honoured with his Royal sanction.</p>
<p>The subject of Incorporation then remained dormant till about
the year 1852, when, the inhabitants thinking that Brighton was
of sufficient importance to be placed on an equality with other
towns of like population and influence, agitated for a
Charter.&nbsp; The opposition of the old governing body was very
great, and the &ldquo;tug of war&rdquo; continued, each party
contending and hoping most zealously.&nbsp; At length the
contenders for the Incorporation prevailed, and the Charter under
the Municipal Act, and bearing date, April 1st, 1854, was
granted.&nbsp; In 1860, in order to remedy many known defects,
the Local Government Act of 1858, was adopted, after a <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>severe
contest.&nbsp; The Corporation consists of the Mayor, the
Recorder, 12 Aldermen, and 36 Councillors, six for each Ward, the
Wards being the Park Ward, Pavilion Ward, Pier Ward, St.
Peter&rsquo;s Ward, St. Nicholas&rsquo; Ward, and West
Ward.&nbsp; The Magistracy consists of the Mayor, the last
ex-Mayor, the Recorder, the Stipendiary Magistrate,&mdash;at
present A. Bigge, Esq.,&mdash;and other Magistrates whose
appointments are sanctioned by the Secretary of State for the
Home Department.&nbsp; The present Magistrates are, His Worship
the Mayor, J. Allfree, Esq., J. C. Burrows, Esq., W. Catt, Esq.,
J. Fawcett, Esq., W. Furner, Esq., W. M. Hollis, Esq., M. D.
Scott, Esq., B. Stent, Esq., W. F. Smithe, Esq., T. Warner, Esq.,
and W. Alger, Esq., who also acts in that capacity by virtue of
being the last ex-Mayor.&nbsp; Ewen Evershed, Esq., is the Clerk
of the Peace.&nbsp; The Mayors hitherto, have been:&mdash;</p>

<p>The great increase of the population during the course of the
last hundred years, is the surest criterion, whereby to judge of
the rapid progress of the town:&mdash;</p>

<p>Brighton had, comparatively speaking, stood aloof from
politics till the passing of the Reform Bill, in 1832, the
inhabitants, not being free-holders, having had no voice in
framing the House of Commons.&nbsp; Under the fostering wing of
George IV. Brighton could not be otherwise than Tory; but the
Royal Patron of the town being dead and his successor William IV.
possessing different political views to his deceased brother, and
others besides the aborigines <a name="page250"></a><span

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XXVI.<br />
THE MARINE PAVILION AND ITS OCCUPANTS.</h2>
<p>The ascendency of Brighton over every other marine resort in
the kingdom may be regarded as having been established by the
attachment to the town of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,
George IV., who in 1782&mdash;when he was about twenty years of
age,&mdash;honoured it for the first time with his presence on
the occasion of his visit to his uncle, the Duke of Cumberland,
who then occupied Grove House.&nbsp; The auspicious event was
celebrated by the inhabitants with a general illumination, every
pane of glass in the town displaying a candle stuck in a lump of
clay, the primitive style of candlestick for illuminations before
coloured glass well oil-lamps, called Coronation Lamps, came into
vogue, previous to the adoption of gas.</p>
<p>The following year the Prince repeated the visit, occupying
the house adjoining Grove House, belonging to Thomas Kemp, Esq.,
of whom it was subsequently purchased by his Royal
Highness.&nbsp; This house formed the nucleus of the Marine
Pavilion, the erection of which commenced in 1784, and the
building was completed in 1787.&nbsp; At this period a barn stood
out abruptly in East Street, at the corner of North Street, but
as it incommoded the public drive it was taken down, and a
handsome house,&mdash;the original of the present north-east <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>corner of
North Street,&mdash;was erected at the rear of its site, by Mr.
Hall, surgeon.&nbsp; The other dwellings, northward to Carlisle
House, were then built.&nbsp; The east or sea front of the
Pavilion, which extended about 200 feet, consisted of a circular
building in the centre supported by stone Doric pillars, and
crowned with a dome, and on each side there was a range of
bow-fronted apartments one story high above the basement, with
balconies and verandahs.&nbsp; The entrance front was towards
East Street.&nbsp; It consisted of a plain main building to
which, in 1802, were added two projecting wings, that formed a
square fore-court, in the centre of which was a handsome
sun-dial, supported by the figure of a negro that was much
admired for its beauty of design and accuracy of sculpture.</p>
<p>Immediately north of the Pavilion was Marlborough House, the
property and residence of the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough.&nbsp; It was a massive square building of brick, two
stories high, and a part of the east front formed a noble bow
having three windows on each floor.&nbsp; There were six windows
also on each floor in this front besides those in the bow.&nbsp;
A range of nine windows on each floor faced the north.&nbsp; The
northern boundary wall of Marlborough House was in a direct line
with the present southern wall of the Pavilion Stables, and the
cluster of elms on the gentle mound just north of the present
Pavilion marks the site of the Duke&rsquo;s residence, which was
a temple of benevolence and charity, the poor and needy, daily
participating in his bounty.&nbsp; The following extracts from
the <i>Morning Herald</i> will show that his Grace&rsquo;s good
deeds to the poor extended over a series of years:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Brighton</span>, August 10th,
1796.&mdash;The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, with their
household, leave here on the 17th inst.&nbsp; Six weeks is
generally the time for their Graces&rsquo; residence here, but
this summer they have overstopped their stay.&nbsp; The Duke of
Marlborough&rsquo;s liberality affords a good and generous lesson
to the other nobility who occasionally reside here; for the
victuals and milk (the latter a scarce article in this town),
that is left amongst the household, is distributed every morning,
in parcels, to the poor of the place; a good day&rsquo;s
provision for several fishermen&rsquo;s wife and children.</p>
<p>August 18th, 1806.&mdash;The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough
and Lady A. Spencer seemed greatly to enjoy, from the windows of
Marlborough House, the parade of the South Gloucester Militia on
the Level.&mdash;A crowd of the indigent inhabitants of this
place, from the kitchen of Marlborough House, returned with
smiling faces, and aprons, &amp;c., well filled with provisions,
to their families, at an early hour this morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>The
entrance of Marlborough House was to the west, where the road
formed the public way from East Street to Marlborough Row, which
consisted of nine houses, whereof North House&mdash;that now
contiguous to the northern entrance of the Pavilion
Grounds&mdash;was No. 9.&nbsp; It was a boulder-fronted house,
having adjoining it to the north, Coupland&rsquo;s
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, with three horse-shoes on a board
adorning its front.&nbsp; These premises projected from the front
line of the south side of Church Street; and, connected with
them, were the dwelling-houses of Mr. Coupland and Mr. Beattie,
and Beattie&rsquo;s donkey stables, the whole group of buildings,
for many years after the Pavilion and Grounds became royal
property, disgracing the approach to the Sovereign&rsquo;s
residence and destroying the uniformity of the street.&nbsp;
Eventually, the town purchased the property, and it was then
wholly cleared away.&nbsp; The other houses of Marlborough Row
were cant-bow fronted and were approached by four steps
each.&nbsp; They were principally lodging-houses; but in 1800,
No. 2,&mdash;opposite Marlborough House,&mdash;was in the
occupation of Mr. John Wymark, baker, and in September, that
year, on the occasion of a fire breaking out upon his premises,
on a Saturday night, the Prince of Wales received the unfortunate
family, and exerted himself in protecting their goods, which were
taken for safety into the Pavilion.</p>
<p>The grounds attached to the Royal Pavilion and Marlborough
House were, originally, of very limited proportions, those to the
east front consisting only of a narrow lawn west of a direct line
northward from the east front of the houses that form the
north-east corner of Castle Square, on the Steine.&nbsp; But in
consideration of the Prince and the Duke constructing in 1793,
the sewer to carry off the stream which flooded the Steine in
winter, the Lords of the
Manor,&mdash;Brighthelmston-Lewes&mdash;with consent of the
homage, gave them permission to enclose a certain portion of the
Steine,&mdash;the Marlborough Steine, as it was
termed,&mdash;adjoining their houses respectively; but never to
build or encumber it with anything that might obstruct the
prospect, or be any way a nuisance to the Steine.&nbsp; The
ground then taken in was parted from the Steine by park palings,
and posts and rails were put along the outer side to form a
foot-way for the public.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>In
1800, His Royal Highness purchased the principal portion of the
Pavilion property to the south, of Mr. Weltjie, but no important
improvements were undertaken until the following year, when, His
Royal Highness having purchased the Elm Grove Gardens, the
permission of the inhabitants was given him to enclose the old
London Road, which ran direct northward from the top of East
Street, on his making the New Road at his own expense.&nbsp; By
this alteration, the Grove, and the shrubberies and
pleasure-grounds of the Duke of Marlborough, which he likewise
purchased, became united with the Pavilion Grounds.</p>
<p>The Promenade Grove or Public Gardens, which were under the
particular patronage of the Prince of Wales, occupied the space
of the present Pavilion Grounds, directly south of the Royal
Stables, as also the site of the stables, and were approached by
way of Prince&rsquo;s Place, an arched gateway occupying the
space whereon stand the premises now occupied as the First Sussex
Volunteer Rifle Orderly Room.&nbsp; Prince&rsquo;s Place was
intended chiefly for the accommodation of the London tradesmen
who came to Brighton with their wares for the season.&nbsp; An
enclosed shrubbery of small dimensions occupied the centre of the
open space, and the carriage drive was about it.</p>
<p>The gardens were surrounded with large overspreading elms,
hence the name of the Grove, and in the hottest day of Summer a
luxuriantly refreshing shade was afforded the fashionable
promenaders who supported by subscription the establishment,
which was open every day during the season.&nbsp; On Wednesdays a
public breakfast was provided, when a band of music attended, and
played at proper intervals select pieces of music.&nbsp; The
breakfasts, when the weather was fine, were well attended, and
boasted of all the elegance and the fashion in Brighton.&nbsp;
Parties also, at other times went there to breakfast, drink tea,
take refreshments&mdash;which were provided in
abundance,&mdash;read the papers, &amp;c.&nbsp; It possessed a
well-appointed saloon, fitted up in an elegant style: adjoining
which was an octagon-shaped orchestra.&nbsp; On particular nights
the Gardens were brilliantly illuminated, and displays of
fireworks were given; at which times the admissions were
half-a-crown, and the entertainments were conducted with the
greatest order and decorum.&nbsp; Upon <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>stripping
the walls of the house formerly inhabited by Mr. Johnson,
recently purchased by Mr. Bradley, in Bond Street, a bill, having
reference to these Gardens, and printed as follows, was brought
to light:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Under the patronage of

</blockquote>
<p>The Promenade Grove, as a place of public entertainment,
closed with a Grand Gala, which terminated with the spectacle of
the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, on the 19th of September,
1802.</p>
<p>In 1805, the Royal Stables were commenced, after the plan and
under the direction of Mr. Porden.&nbsp; They may be reckoned as
the first great architectural work in Brighton.&nbsp; The centre
of the building which supports the dome is circular, and contains
a spacious reservoir of water for the stables which surround
it.&nbsp; In this circular area the doors of various stables,
comprising sixty-two stalls, open.&nbsp; Somewhat elevated, a
gallery leads, by way of two staircases, to the several
apartments of the servants required about the stables.&nbsp; The
circumference of this spacious building is 250 feet, and the dome
which surmounts it is nearly of the magnitude of that of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, London.&nbsp; On the west side is the
magnificent Riding School, 200 feet long and 50 broad; and
eastward of the dome was a spacious Tennis Court.&nbsp; The
Parochial Offices occupy much of this latter space, which had
previously, by <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>order of William IV., been added to the stables, a
blank screen front to the east giving the buildings an appearance
of uniformity.&nbsp; There are two grand entrances to the
stables, the one from Church Street, through a lofty archway
which enters into a spacious square court, containing the
coach-houses, carriage-horse stables, and general offices.&nbsp;
A similar archway leads to the circular dome, opposite to which
is a corresponding entrance from the Pavilion lawn.&nbsp; On the
east and west sides of the circle are similar archways leading to
the Riding School and the Tennis Ground.</p>
<p>The neglected state of these premises is a disgrace as well to
the nation as to the town; for while Englishmen pride themselves
on the vaunted greatness of their country, such is the reduced
condition of her military resources that she is compelled to beg
house-room of the civil authorities for the accommodation of her
soldiers, in a town where two ranges of barracks are inadequate
to the requirements of a single regiment.&nbsp; The Town Council
are bound in justice to the ratepayers to appropriate the
premises to purposes for which little or no provision is
made.&nbsp; The Courts of Justice in Brighton are libels on the
name; the police accommodation is meagre in the extreme, persons
only suspected of a crime being placed in underground dungeons
similar to which criminals convicted of the darkest crimes would
not by any British Government be permitted to be consigned; and
while other towns with less pretensions to greatness than
Brighton have their Public Baths and Wash-houses, these premises,
which may be easily converted on a small outlay to meet all the
requirements alluded to, are permitted to be illegally let and
grossly misapplied, to the detriment of the property and the
inconvenience of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The most memorable event, in connexion with the Royal Stables,
was the celebration of the Jubilee of the Fiftieth Year of the
Reign of George III., by Mr. Philip Mighell feasting 2,000 of the
poorest inhabitants of the town, by permission of the Prince of
Wales, in the Royal Riding Room, on Wednesday, October the 25th
1809.&nbsp; The following is a copy of the letter to Mr. Mighell,
conveying the sanction of His Royal Highness:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Pavilion, Brighton, Oct.
20th, 1809.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I am commanded by the Prince of Wales, to acquaint
you that His <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>Royal Highness will have great satisfaction in
affording the accommodation of his Riding House upon the happy
occasion to which your letter refers, and which His Royal
Highness sees in a most laudable view.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sir, your Obedt Servt.,<br />
<span class="smcap">Benj. Bloomfield</span>. <a
name="citation257"></a><a href="#footnote257"
class="citation">[257]</a></p>
<p>P. Mighell, Esq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eventful day was ushered in by the ringing of bells, the
British Flag majestically waving on the venerable tower of St.
Nicholas&rsquo; Church, to which place of Divine Worship the
Freemasons of the Royal Clarence Lodge, and their visiting
brethren from the neighbouring Lodges, proceeded in procession,
about eleven o&rsquo;clock, the Band of the South Gloucester
Militia taking the lead, and announcing their approach by their
harmony.&nbsp; An appropriate sermon was preached by the Rev. Mr.
Tilt; at the conclusion of which&mdash;there being then no organ
in the church,&mdash;the Musicians of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
Band performed the Coronation Anthem.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock
a royal salute was fired from the Battery, and it was repeated by
a gun-brig, then lying off the town.&nbsp; About half-past one
o&rsquo;clock the doors of the Royal Riding House, in Church
Street, were thrown open for the admission of the benevolent Mr.
Mighell&rsquo;s party, in number about two thousand three
hundred, exclusive of a hundred stewards, who assisted upon the
occasion.&nbsp; The greatest order and decorum prevailed
throughout the feast; everybody was happy, and not an unpleasant
incident occurred to mar the harmony of the proceedings.&nbsp;
Mr. Phillips, of the New Inn Hotel, who was afterwards known as
Jubilee Phillips, had the management of the dinner, the potatoes
for which were a gift, and were dug from Mr. Mighell&rsquo;s
garden,&mdash;whereon now stands Queen Square,&mdash;by his
nephew, Mr. Richard Mighell, at present of Albany Villas,
Cliftonville.&nbsp; In the farm-yard of Mr. Scrase, about three
hundred yards from the Riding House, fifteen hundred poor <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>persons
were also dined, at the expense of a party of gentlemen, who
opened a subscription for the same benevolent purpose, and
similar order and harmony prevailed.&nbsp; On
retiring,&mdash;which they did about five
o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;the grateful recipients gave expression to
their loyalty, and invoked blessings on Mr. Mighell and their
other liberal friends.&nbsp; The Freemasons dined in their Lodge
Room, at the Old Ship&mdash;then kept by Mr. John
Hicks,&mdash;where, also, in the evening, was a Ball and
Supper.</p>
<p>In 1803, the Prince purchased property in Castle Square,
adjoining the old stables, and year by year, till 1806, constant
additions and improvements were made to His Royal
Highness&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; Castle Square, just at its
junction with North Street, was, in July 1811, the scene of the
last punishment by the pillory in Brighton.&nbsp; The culprit was
a man named Fuller, a native of Lewes; at the petty Sessions of
which town&mdash;Brighton then having no bench of
magistrates,&mdash;he was convicted of passing at Brighton a
two-penny for a two-pound note.&nbsp; The structure of the
pillory was upon a platform raised about ten feet from the
ground.&nbsp; It consisted of a frame connected with an upright
pillar, around which it revolved, and was made with holes and
folding boards, through which the head and hands of the criminal
were put, and from twelve to one o&rsquo;clock he continued to
take the circuit of an area of about eighteen feet diameter,
under the superintendence of Mr. Harry Colbron, the High
Constable, who, with his Headboroughs, escorted their prisoner to
the place of punishment from the King and Queen Inn, to which
house he had been brought from Lewes by the authorities of the
House of Correction.&nbsp; A great concourse of the inhabitants
assembled to witness the punishment, which was conducted by
Catling, the beadle.&nbsp; The stage and pillory were constructed
by Messrs. Colbron and Saunders.</p>
<p>In 1814, the Prince purchased Marlborough House; and the same
year the houses and shops on the north side of Castle Square, and
the whole of the old stables and coach-houses between the south
side of the Pavilion, and terminating in a line with the bottom
of North Street, were pulled down, and a noble range of domestic
offices was erected on the site.&nbsp; Immediately north of the
stables were the residence and grounds of Mr. Louis Weltjie,
Clerk <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>of
the Prince&rsquo;s Kitchen.&nbsp; A portion of his brick-fronted
house still remains, just within the southern entrance of the
Pavilion Grounds.&nbsp; Weltjie and his wife were Germans, who
had saved money while in the service of several of the nobility,
and they invested it in the purchase of the property which they
afterwards disposed of to the Prince, who reposed such confidence
in Weltjie, that in December, 1788, upon His Royal Highness
being&mdash;as was his perpetual condition,&mdash;in pecuniary
embarrassment, and it had been determined by himself and his
royal brothers, the Duke of York and the Duke of
Clarence,&mdash;who were also in difficulties,&mdash;to speculate
upon the prince&rsquo;s accession to power in consequence of the
afflicting malady of their royal father, George III., Weltjie was
selected as one of a party to effect a negociation in England,
Ireland, and Scotland, of some post-obit bonds.&nbsp; Weltjie,
however, fearing the consequences, withdrew from the project by
introducing two persons of property and extensive money
connexions, one of whom on the 16th of that month, perfected a
bargain secured by the three royal brothers, for &pound;30,000,
payable when a <i>certain event</i> should take place.&nbsp; The
bonds went into &ldquo;The Market,&rdquo; and the witless
purchasers who had obtained them at a premium, being afraid to
acknowledge that they held any such obligations,&mdash;inasmuch
as by anticipating the death of the sovereign they subjected the
parties to all the penalties of petty treason,&mdash;their
redemption was never claimed.&nbsp; Annexed is a copy of the bond
referred to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Know all</span> men by these

<p>In May, 1813. at a Court Baron of the
Manor,&mdash;Brighthelmston-Lewes,&mdash;leave was given to the
Prince Regent <a name="citation260"></a><a href="#footnote260"
class="citation">[260]</a> to extend the fence which surrounded
the Marlborough domains to the Royal Mews, and in 1815 His Royal
Highness erected the lower section of the east and north
boulder-fronted wall, placing on it the dwarf palisading that now
crowns it, as raised to its present height; and in 1817
Marlborough Row became the Prince&rsquo;s property, and its site
was added to the Royal Domain, which was then made to occupy an
area of about seven acres.</p>
<p>Prior to 1817, the royal visitors to the Prince of Wales had
been his Royal Consort, the Princess of Wales, in August, 1795,
his daughter, the Princess Charlotte, July 27th, 1807, his
brothers, the Dukes of Sussex, York, Clarence, Kent, Cumberland,
and Cambridge, and their Royal Mother, Queen Charlotte, who paid
her only visit to Brighton, accompanied by the Princesses
Elizabeth and Mary, on the 24th of October, 1814, and they
continued their stay till the 29th of that month, during which
period Her Majesty graciously ordered the distribution of
&pound;50 to the poor, and became, with a liberal donation, the
Patroness of the Dollar Society for the relief of the
indigent.&nbsp; The Princesses were also donors to the
Society.&nbsp; The foreign potentates who had been visitors were
the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia.&nbsp; Various
princes of the crowned heads of Europe had also paid their
respects to the Prince, whose companions were the elite, if not
the most dissolute of the nobility of the day.&nbsp; So
notorious, in fact, were the doings at the Pavilion, that Lord
Chancellor Thurlow, himself not the purest in conduct nor the
most refined in manners, <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>refrained from calling upon the
Prince.&nbsp; One day, while walking on the Steine, his Lordship
was met by His Royal Highness, in company with Lord Barrymore,
Sir John Lade, <a name="citation261a"></a><a href="#footnote261a"
class="citation">[261a]</a> and other like companions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thurlow,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;how is it that you
have not called on me?&nbsp; You must name a day when you will
dine with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Thurlow, casting a look round
upon the Prince&rsquo;s friends, said, &ldquo;I cannot do so
until your Royal Highness keeps better company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord
Thurlow died of the gout at Brighton, on the 12th of September,
1806, his dying words being, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shot if I
don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst the most notorious of the Prince&rsquo;s companions
were the brothers Barrymore, the eldest,&mdash;who had been
ordained to the church,&mdash;being known amongst them, for his
irreligious propensities, as Hellgate; the second, for his
immorality, Newgate; and the third, for his lameness,
Cripplegate.&nbsp; The latter was the survivor of the infamous
trio, his infirmities not permitting him to indulge in the vices
which prematurely terminated the career of his brothers.&nbsp;
They had a sister, who surpassed them in evil qualifications, and
she bore, for her coarse volubility, the nickname of
Billingsgate.&nbsp; Another of the <i>clique</i> was Colonel
Hanger, familiarly known as George Hanger, the Knight of the
Black Diamond, the wit and satirist of the party.&nbsp; His Life,
<a name="citation261b"></a><a href="#footnote261b"
class="citation">[261b]</a> written by himself, abounds with
sarcasms and truisms, but though designed to &ldquo;point a
moral,&rdquo; it does not &ldquo;adorn a tale,&rdquo; that teems
with sensualities.&nbsp; Upon one occasion Sheridan and Hanger
were dining in the room of the old building where the Prince
usually dined, <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>termed by them, in consequence of its contracted
dimensions and generally excessively heated condition, the Royal
Oven.&nbsp; In the course of the meal Sheridan said, &ldquo;How
do you feel yourself, Hanger?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hot,
hot;&mdash;hot as h&mdash;l,&rdquo; replied Hanger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is quite right,&rdquo; was Sheridan&rsquo;s severe
rejoinder, &ldquo;we should be prepared in this world for that
which we know will be our lot in another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reckless
roistering and inconsiderate practical joking were the delight of
the Pavilion party, the hours of the night being principally the
time when they immoderately enjoyed themselves.&nbsp; Upon one
occasion, on a dark evening, they procured a coffin, and having
put into it something resembling a corpse, dressed in a shroud,
they stood it on end, without a lid, in front of the door of a
tradesman&rsquo;s house, at which they knocked, and then hid
away.&nbsp; On the servant &ldquo;answering the door,&rdquo; as
it is termed, the light of the candle in her hand displayed the
spectre-like figure, which so frightened the poor girl that she
shrieked and fainted.&nbsp; The inmates of the house, taking the
alarm, ran to the door, and were equally terror-stricken.&nbsp;
Cries of help quickly brought to their assistance many
neighbours; but the concoctors of the joke had taken the
precaution to fix to the handles of the coffin a strong rope, by
means of which they, with little trouble, drew away the cause of
the alarm; and there being thus nothing left to be frightened at,
the inmates of the house became, for some time, laughing stocks
for their credulity.</p>
<p>The numerous tricks practised upon the townsfolk did not in
the least offend them, as in the event of any damage being done,
that could be recompensed in a pecuniary way, the greatest
liberality was always shown; in fact, the inhabitants had found
that Royalty was the staple article upon which they existed, and
they so assimilated their ideas with their position, that their
chief fears were that they might by some inadvertence or
mischance give the Prince offence, hence His Royal Highness was
their chief study.&nbsp; The feeling, however, was graciously
reciprocated by the Royal visitor, as exhibited upon the occasion
of the anniversary of the birthday of His Royal Highness, August
12th, 1806&mdash;and it was generally so on like
events&mdash;when a deputation of the inhabitants <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>presented
to the Prince the following address, to which every householder
of note had previously subscribed his name:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To his Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>We, the Ministers, High Constable, Churchwardens, Overseers,
and principal Inhabitants of the Town of Brighthelmston, with the
most grateful recollection of the many gracious instances of your
Royal Highness&rsquo;s patronage conferred upon us, to which
alone are to be attributed that prosperity and those advantages
unfelt by, and unknown to, any other Provincial Town, most humbly
approach your Royal Highness, to express the dutiful and thankful
sentiments which this recollection inspires, and more
particularly calls forth on the anniversary of this day.&nbsp;
While we entreat your Royal Highness to accept these our humble
acknowledgments and congratulations, we devoutly implore the
Supreme Disposer of all events long to preserve a life so
invaluable to us, to whom your immediate protection is so
liberally dispensed, and so dear and important in its general
consequences to the nation at large.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His Royal Highness replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Accept my best thanks for this Address.&nbsp; Be assured that
I feel a lively interest in the prosperity of this place, and
shall ever promote its welfare as far as lies in my power.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George</span>,
<i>Prince</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has hitherto, in general, passed current, that the
predilection of the Prince of Wales for Brighton arose from the
combination of the extent of the marine view which the town
commanded, the salubrity of the place, and the great superiority
of its sea-bathing; in confirmation of which last attraction
prints are extant representing, of life size, Martha Gunn, the
bather, bearing in her arms a naked &ldquo;four-year old&rdquo;
baby, purporting to represent the youthful form of His Royal
Highness, about to undergo the process of dipping; whereas it is
well known that he had attained the age of a score of years
before he first visited Brighton.&nbsp; The portrait of Martha no
doubt is correct, but the infant in her arms is but an adjunct to
distinguish her from the fish women, whose costume at that period
was similar to the female bather.&nbsp; The Royal Bathing
Machine, which for some years was so conspicuous on the beach at
the bottom of the Steine, was that used by the Prince when he
bathed under the guidance of Smoaker Miles, at the bottom of
Russell street.&nbsp; It finished its days at the Steine, whither
it was removed for the transit of His Royal Highness along the
sand, at low-water, to the boat that conveyed him to and from the
Royal <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>yacht, which, during the temporary abode of the Prince
in Brighton, was usually stationed, with a convoy of two ships of
war, off Brighton, at the moorings, which were laid down and
marked by buoys about six miles from the shore.&nbsp; The Royal
machine was retained at the Steine, amongst the ladies&rsquo;
bathing machines, as it was much in request by the gentler sex,
who were always anxious to occupy the machine from whence the
Prince had taken a &ldquo;header,&rdquo; or travelled to his
yacht.</p>
<p>Much, in the way of anecdote, has been transmitted to us
orally, respecting Martha Gunn, especially in reference to the
Prince and the Pavilion; but, besides being a bather little of
her life is known.&nbsp; In a rare work, &ldquo;A Donkey Tour to
Brighton,&rdquo; <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> occurs the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;What, my old friend,
Martha,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;still queen of the ocean, still
industrious, and busy as ever; and how do you find
yourself?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well and hearty, thank God,
Sir,&rsquo; replied she, &lsquo;but rather hobbling.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t bathe, because I a&rsquo;nt so strong as I used to
be, so I superintend on the beach, for I&rsquo;m up before any of
&rsquo;em; you may always find me and my pitcher, at one exact
spot, every morning by six o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You
wear vastly well, my old friend, pray what age may you
be?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Only eighty-eight, Sir; in fact,
eighty-nine come next Christmas pudding; aye, and though
I&rsquo;ve lost my teeth, I can mumble it with as good relish and
hearty appetite as anybody.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to
hear it; Brighton would not look like itself without you,
Martha,&rsquo; said I.&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,
it&rsquo;s like to do without me, some day,&rsquo; answered she,
&lsquo;but while I&rsquo;ve health and life, I must be bustling
amongst my old friends and benefactors; I think I ought to be
proud, for I&rsquo;ve as many bows from man, woman, and child, as
the Prince hisself; aye, I do believe, the very dogs in the town
know me.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And your son, how is he?&rsquo; said
I.&mdash;&lsquo;Brave and charming, he lives in East Street; if
your honour wants any prime pickled salmon, or oysters, there you
have &rsquo;em.&rsquo;&mdash;I promised her I&rsquo;d be a
customer; she made me a low curtsey, and I left her hobbling to
the side of the London coach, to deliver cards from the
repository of her poor withered, sea-freckled <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>bosom; for,
like a woman of fashion, her bosom was her pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales had an unbounded propensity for gallantry,
and his companions of broken fortunes about him ingratiated
themselves in his favour by pandering to his evil
propensities.&nbsp; The Pavilion of Brighton, therefore, being
secluded, was chosen as his favourite resort, whereto were
brought the mistresses of his passions; and such a notoriety did
the building attain that it was commonly spoken of as &ldquo;the
residence having at one end a harem, and at the other a
chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp; An incident of one of his early visits to
Brighton will exhibit his irresistance of temptation.&nbsp; His
Royal Highness, while walking on the beach, was struck with the
beauty of a nymph who was reclining by one of the groynes.&nbsp;
Her name was Charlotte Fortescue, an illiterate female, who
counteracted her defective educational qualifications by artifice
and intrigue, and by her art she threw such an air of simplicity
and innocence over her actions as to hide the real nature of her
character from the Prince, whose exalted position she soon
discovered.&nbsp; Again and again he met her; and believed that
he had gained her confidence.&nbsp; Tears suffused her cheeks as
she spoke of a marriage to which she was about to be forced, that
would take her from her native country.&nbsp; The Prince
eventually proposed an elopement, and in order to give a romantic
air to the affair, it was arranged that the dress of a footman
was to be procured for his frail fugitive, and that His Royal
Highness that evening should have his ph&aelig;ton in waiting a
few miles on the London Road, to bear away his prize.&nbsp;
However, while the Prince was dressing for dinner, Colonel
Hanger, who had just commenced his life of profligacy, was
announced.&nbsp; At dinner the Prince excused himself upon having
to leave them early, as he had most important business to
transact that night in the metropolis.&nbsp; Hanger spoke of
having left there that morning in search of a girl for whom he
had provided private apartments in London, and remarked,
&ldquo;The hussy takes it into her head every now and then to
absent herself for a few days; and I have now been given to
understand that she is carrying on some intrigue with a fellow at
this place.&nbsp; Let me but catch him, and I will souse him over
head and ears in the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little explanation
sufficed to convince them both that the runaway was none other
than the female with whom the Prince was so <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>smitten,
and it was arranged, in order to outwit her, that Hanger should
put on one of the coats in which she had been occasioned to see
her Royal lover, and take his seat on the coach-box, instead of
the Prince.&nbsp; That night Hanger bore off his mistress to
London, much to her chagrin that the romantic elopement should
have such an unexpected termination, as the manner in which His
Royal Highness travelled, one horse before the others, the first
ridden by a postilion, and himself managing the other two,
prevented a recognition till the female footman descended from
the &ldquo;dicky,&rdquo; in London.&nbsp; The imposition
terminated their intimacy.</p>
<p>To detail the numerous acts of gallantry of the Prince and his
associates would in nowise add to the improvement and
enlightenment of the present age; nor is it necessary to give a
biographical sketch or even a list of all his companions.&nbsp;
His connexion, however, with Mrs. Fitzherbert <a
name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266"
class="citation">[266]</a> demands some mention to be made of
that excellent lady who received the most cordial kindness and
formal honours from the first families of distinction in the
land.&nbsp; The Royal Marriage Act, which passed soon after the
commencement of the reign of George III., in consequence of the
marriage of the Duke of Cumberland with Mrs. Horton, and the Duke
of Gloucester with the Countess of Waldegrave, declared that the
descendants of George II., except the offspring of such of the
Princes, as were married to, or might marry foreign Princesses,
were incapable of marrying till the age of five-and-twenty years,
without His Majesty&rsquo;s consent previously obtained; or after
the age of five-and-twenty, in the event of His Majesty&rsquo;s
refusal, without the consent of both Houses of Parliament.&nbsp;
The marriage, then, between the Prince of Wales and Mrs.
Fitzherbert, which Horne Tooke declared did take place, inasmuch
as he was acquainted with the English clergyman who performed the
solemn ceremony on the 21st of December, 1785, was null and
void.&nbsp; Mr. Fox, in the House of Commons, denied that there
had been marriage; but his denial was an act of expediency, <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>as,
according to the Act of William III., the admitted marriage of
the Prince of Wales would have prevented his taking upon himself
the Regency of the country, as the people, from his having
married a Papist, would have been absolved from their
allegiance.&nbsp; Amongst the real friends of the Prince his
connexion with Mrs. Fitzherbert was an event of much
gratification; for irregular as might have been its nature, it
preserved him from the vulgar propensities to which he had been
previously prone.&nbsp; Dowers and legacies of two previous
marriages qualified her to command all the elegancies of
fashionable life, and to perform many noble acts of
charity.&nbsp; A separation only took place in 1795, when the
Prince was about to marry (for the payment of his debts), the
unfortunate Caroline of Brunswick.&nbsp; In such high esteem was
she held by the Royal Family that upon William the IV. ascending
the throne, he, with his Royal Consort, Queen Adelaide, paid her
numerous visits of courtesy.&nbsp; The remains of Mrs.
Fitzherbert, upon her decease, 27th March, 1837, were deposited
in a vault beneath the Roman Catholic Church, St. George&rsquo;s
Road, where a handsome marble monument, by Carew, has been
erected to her memory.&nbsp; Her age was eighty-one.</p>
<p>Some romantic notion gave forth the rumour that a subterranean
communication existed between the Royal Pavilion and Mrs
Fitzherbert&rsquo;s house, on the Steine.&nbsp; A greater fallacy
never gained credence.&nbsp; All that she possessed, connected in
any way with the estate, were the stables in the New Road,
immediately north of the row of trees which bounds the Pavilion
Grounds on the east.&nbsp; These stables&mdash;erected in
1806&mdash;are now used as the chief dep&ocirc;t of the Borough
Fire Brigade, under Inspector Quartermain.&nbsp; They were
immediately contiguous to the Burial Ground of the Society of
Friends,&mdash;now the Corporation premises for depositing the
Town Surveyor&rsquo;s materials,&mdash;and for a window in the
stables that overlooked the ground Mrs. Fitzherbert paid one
penny per month, as will appear by the following minute of the
Committee of Friends:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Brighton, 13th of 11th

pay one penny per month for such permission, and also undertaking
to brick-up the same, at any time within one week after notice
for that purpose from any of the trustees or committee for the
said premises, and in default thereof that any of the Friends be
authorized to brick-up the said window at the expense of the said

</blockquote>
<p>A subterranean passage is in existence from the Pavilion to
the Stables, and was the medium by which, in disguise, the Prince
and his friends went to and returned&mdash;comparatively in
private&mdash;from their nocturnal rambles.&nbsp; Its immediate
connexion with the royal suite of rooms was by means of a trap in
the floor of one of the apartments, beneath which was an
intricate staircase that gave him a means of ready exit; as,
besides using it on occasions of fun and frolic, his constant
fear of attempts upon his life from political motives,&mdash;as
on the occasion of his being shot at with an air-gun, on his
return from opening Parliament in 1817,&mdash;or in consequence
of his numerous amorous peccadillos, rendered a means of escape
desirable, and he was enabled also, in case of emergency, to
attain with great facility the various galleries that ramified
the roofs of the building.</p>
<p>The New Road&mdash;previously the garden of Mr Furner, the
Prince&rsquo;s gardener,&mdash;was formed in 1805, by privates of
the Royal Artillery; and on Monday, August 12th,&mdash;the
anniversary of the birth-day of the Prince of Wales,&mdash;His
Royal Highness gave the men employed on the work a guinea
each.&nbsp; In 1807, there was a west entrance to the Pavilion
Grounds, directly opposite the Theatre.&nbsp; On the 14th of
August, that year, it happened that the Prince, purposing going
out that way in the evening, found the gate shut and
locked.&nbsp; His Royal Highness called out to his attendants to
break the gate open,&mdash;an order which they attempted to obey,
but found themselves unequal to the task.&nbsp; The Prince <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>smiling,
desired them to stand aside, as he had no doubt but his strength
was sufficient to force the place, though their&rsquo;s had
failed.&nbsp; In an instant he wrenched the gate from its hinges,
and with his party passed on to the Theatre.</p>
<p>The trees in the New Road were not planted till 1812.&nbsp;
The double row of elms immediately west formed the east range of
Elm Grove, and in 1817 became the first resort of the rooks,
which had been driven away from Preston Rookery by Mr.
Stanford.&nbsp; These birds do not winter in Brighton, but come
from Stanmer Park&mdash;whither they migrate,&mdash;annually
towards the end of February.</p>
<p>The great additions to the Royal Pavilion, or rather its
reconstruction, so as to remain and adopt some portions of the
original building, commenced in 1817, Nash being the
architect.&nbsp; It is of no fixed style of architecture, but is
a composite of the Moorish and Chinese.&nbsp; An Indian style was
offered by Repton, who on the publication of it, upon its being
rejected by the Prince, adopted the term &ldquo;Pavilion,&rdquo;
both in the plates and in the letter-press.&nbsp; The style
selected is admired by some persons, but much ridiculed by
critics.&nbsp; Sidney Smith said &ldquo;the building looked as if
the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s, London, had come down to Brighton
and pupped;&rdquo; whilst William Cobbett observed that &ldquo;a
good idea of the building might be formed by placing the pointed
half of a large turnip upon the middle of a board, with four
smaller ones at the corners.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pagoda towers,
which form the north and south wings, are much admired for the
beauty of their proportions, and for their inversion from the
roof in a spheroidical elevation.&nbsp; They are covered with
thin plates of iron, coated with mihl or mastic of great
durability.&nbsp; The domes, and the minarets, which consist of
open cupolas on tall pillars, have a similar covering of
mastic.</p>
<p>In adapting the north pagoda to a concert room, every
attention was paid by the architect to combine the harmony of the
music in the perfect equilibrium of tone produced by each
instrument.&nbsp; The Prince of Wales, who was a fine judge and
promoter of music, made many suggestions to counteract the too
great elevation of the ceiling, which somewhat destroyed the
combination and vibration of sound, and under his accomplished
taste the acme of scientific proportions of combination and sound
was attained.&nbsp; The first time <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>that this music room was used was
about the middle of January, 1818, the performers being the
Prince Regent&rsquo;s private band.&nbsp; The organ, by Mr
Lincoln, was not erected till the end of that year.&nbsp; The
organ previously used in the Pavilion was taken there on the 18th
of November, 1805.&nbsp; The instrument now used in the room
formerly stood in the Royal Chapel, and was the gift of her
present Majesty to the town.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to give a detailed description of the whole
of the apartments of the Pavilion, or the furniture therein; it
will suffice to say that with the exception of the Chinese
Gallery, and the suite of rooms which forms the east front, there
was not, while it remained Royal property, a room that would
content any commoner of substance.&nbsp; The throne room, with
its tawdry adjuncts, was vile in taste and of meagre proportions;
wholly devoid of the grandeur and nobleness which should attach
itself to Royalty.&nbsp; A casual observer of the present day
would be led to suppose that the apartment was the lodge-room of
some benefit society, or the smoking crib of George IV., the
raised canopied dais being appointed for the chairman at Lodge
Meetings, or for His Gracious Majesty when he presided over his
Royal Pavilion midnight orgies.&nbsp; The whole of the
King&rsquo;s Apartments, as they were designated, were of a like
character; but they afforded him a contentment, inasmuch, as,
from his bedroom,&mdash;by the secret stairs to which the bloated
Marchioness of Conyngham descended from her chamber,&mdash;to the
capacious marble bath where his Majesty laved, there was a
seclusion to which in his later years he became habituated.&nbsp;
The upper rooms of the Pavilion, are, for a Palace, low pitched,
of very contracted dimensions, and from two windows alone, those
in the large dome, is a sufficient view of the sea obtained to
permit of the building being termed a Marine Pavilion.&nbsp; The
furniture throughout the building was costly in the extreme, but
incongruous.&nbsp; Huish, in his &ldquo;Memoirs of George
IV.,&rdquo; says:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing could exceed the
indignation of the people, when the Civil List came before
Parliament in May, 1816, and &pound;50,000 were found to have
been expended in furniture at Brighton, immediately after
&pound;534,000 had been voted for covering the excess of the
Civil List, occasioned entirely by the reckless extravagance <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>of the
Prince Regent, whose morning levees were not attended by men of
science and of genius, who could have instilled into his mind
wholesome notions of practical economy; but the tailor, the
upholsterer, the jeweller, and the shoemaker were the regular
attendants of his morning recreations.&rdquo;&nbsp; On one of
these occasions his servant entered his apartment at the Pavilion
with the information, &ldquo;<i>She</i> is come, your Royal
Highness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince,
&ldquo;who is <i>she</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>She</i> is
come,&rdquo; repeated the servant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ask,&rdquo;
replied the Prince in an angry tone, &ldquo;who is
<i>she</i>?&mdash;where does <i>she</i> come from?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is <i>Shea</i> the tailor, from London, your Royal
Highness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Prince smiled, and the <i>Shea</i> was
admitted immediately into the royal presence.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the great alterations and improvements at the
Royal Pavilion marking an epoch for Brighton, in 1817, that year
is also memorable in the town for the 5th of November riot, which
then took place, referred to in page <span class="indexpageno"><a

I&rsquo;ll read the riot act, I&rsquo;ve got it here!<br />
Go get the troops, and then we need not fear!<br />
How many troops? the soaking hero cri&rsquo;d,<br />
All that you can, the learned bear repli&rsquo;d.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The

<p>Now to the Barracks flies the soaking chief,<br />

Charge on, exclaimed, no mercy I&rsquo;ll afford!<br />
Why don&rsquo;t you charge?&nbsp; You heard me give the word.<br

Charge! charge! charge! charge! the sable knight replies,<br />
Charge! charge! again the soaking hero cries.<br />
The charge is made, alas, poor luckless Rowles,<br />
Thy life is gone, through these ambitious fools;<br />
The battle&rsquo;s ended, and they look around,<br />
When some are lying stretch&rsquo;d upon the ground;<br />
Some too with cuts and bruises there are found,<br />
Just at the end of this disgusting scene,<br />
A man of peace was walking on the Steine,<br />
The soaking hero cri&rsquo;d What brought you here?<br />
Go home! go home! roar&rsquo;d out the learned bear,<br />
To these insults the man of peace replies,<br />
With indignation beaming in his eyes,<br />
Nothing I said, nor nothing have I done;<br />
So when I please I, therefore, shall go home.<br />
You won&rsquo;t go home, roar&rsquo;d out the learned boar,<br />
So mind to-morrow, from me you shall hear.<br />
<a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>You look
disdainful in my very face!<br />
I&rsquo;ll bind you o&rsquo;er to keep the public peace;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And so to-morrow you may bail him out.<br />

<p>The visits of George IV. to Brighton were discontinued in
1824, in consequence of a deep resentment which His Majesty felt
at some personal affront that was given by some of the
inhabitants, to his then favourite mistress, the Marchioness of
Conyngham, who was the Lady Steward of the Royal Household, and
arrogated to herself the privilege of arranging the <i>entree</i>
to the King, and of possessing control over the commonest
domestics of the establishment.&nbsp; Her effrontery, however,
was too intolerant for some of the townsfolk to brook; and, their
virtuous indignation being aroused, they indulged in remarks upon
her, and were so indifferent in courtesy towards her, that His
Majesty considered the affront as almost given to himself.&nbsp;
In fact, the extraordinary ascendency which the Marchioness had
obtained over the royal mind, was then so apparent in all the
King&rsquo;s actions that he was a Sovereign governed by one
subject, and that subject more influential and powerful in her
authority than the first minister of the State.&nbsp; Upon the
retirement of the King from Brighton, the Princess Augusta was a
frequent visitor to the town, her residence, by permission of her
Royal Brother, being one of the private houses, to the west, just
within the then southern entrance to the Pavilion Grounds.</p>
<p>The Royal Pavilion was a favourite autumn and winter residence
of William IV. and Queen Adelaide, who made their first visit to
Brighton on Monday, August 30th, 1830.&nbsp; Their Majesties
effected many important alterations upon the Royal Property,
causing the erection of the ivy-clad range of buildings known as
the Dormitories, extending along the south margin of the western
lawn, from Prince&rsquo;s Place to Carlisle House.&nbsp; A
southern entrance to the Grounds was erected in 1831.&nbsp; It
stood across the top of East Street, in a line with the north
side of North Street; but upon the Royal Pavilion estate becoming
the property of the Town of <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>Brighton, in 1850, the building was
taken down; as, besides the structure being in nowise handsome,
it was a screen that completely hid the Pavilion, and hemmed in
the property now known as the Pavilion Buildings.&nbsp; The
elegant northern entrance&mdash;a noble and faultless building,
exhibiting every characteristic of boldness and
stateliness,&mdash;was erected in 1832.</p>
<p>During the occupation of the Royal abode by William and
Adelaide,&mdash;when it received the name of The Palace,&mdash;it
was a continued scene of regal festivities, juvenile parties
being very frequent.&nbsp; The present Duke, then Prince George
of Cambridge, was a great favourite with Their Majesties, who
specially humoured his fancies and frolics.&nbsp; Royalty,
however, is very tenacious of its dignity; whereof the following
is a proof: Upon occasions when the youthful aristocracy were
invited to the Palace, it was invariably usual for the
arrangements of the evening to be under the immediate
superintendence of the celebrated <i>maitresse de danse</i>,
Madame Michau, who, not unfrequently, was assisted in her duties
by her son, now well-known as Mons. James Michau, and the
arrangement graciously received the Royal sanction.&nbsp; With
the Prince and his youthful associates the son of the dancing
mistress was considered fair game for their sporting humour; they
therefore resorted to practical joking upon him, well-knowing
that difference in position forbad his making a retort.&nbsp; But
it happened upon one occasion that either the Prince exceeded his
usual indignities, or that young Michau was not in a philosophic
placid temper, as he offered a remonstrance, which excited a blow
from His Royal Highness, resulting in a bout of fisticuffs, from
which the Prince came off second best.&nbsp; The indignity, thus
justly administered, was forthwith resented, the Royal
communication, through Mr. Gee, Her Majesty&rsquo;s page, being
that Madame Michau&rsquo;s services would not again be
required.&nbsp; A retributive incident shortly after occurred
that entirely put an end to the Palace youthful gatherings.&nbsp;
Prince George, for a diversion, had purchased a mechanical mouse,
and, having wound it up, he placed it upon the floor, when it
chanced to travel in the direction of the Queen.&nbsp; Her
Majesty had not observed the toy until it closely approached her,
when, feeling a sudden alarm, she rose hurriedly, uttering an
ejaculation of fear, a procedure so undignifying to her <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>exalted
position that she immediately retired, and no other juvenile
party at the Palace ever after took place.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria paid her first visit to Brighton, October 4th,
1837, and had a most enthusiastic reception.&nbsp; Her
Majesty&rsquo;s second visit took place the following
Autumn.&nbsp; In February, 1842, the Queen and Her Royal Consort,
Prince Albert, made the stay of a month in Brighton; and on the
7th of September, the following year, Her Majesty and the Prince
Consort landed from the Royal Yacht, at the Chain Pier, on their
return from a visit to Louis Philippe, at Chateau
d&rsquo;Eu.&nbsp; The circumstance of their landing is
commemorated by Mr. R. H. Nibbs, in a most exquisite painting
which is placed amongst the local works of art that adorn the
Borough Council Chamber, at the Town Hall.&nbsp; The Queen and
Prince Albert embarked on the 12th for Ostend.&nbsp; In
September, 1844, the last royal visit was made to the Pavilion,
the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, and Prince Alfred being
sent down for the benefit of their health.&nbsp; Their stay
extended to a fortnight.&nbsp; Hopes were entertained that Her
Majesty would again visit Brighton; but time passed on, and at
length it was announced that the Queen had purchased an estate in
the Isle of Wight, where she would have a marine residence, in
the strictest sense of the word, easy of access, and so admirably
situated that she could, with the greatest facility, indulge in
her favourite pastime&mdash;a water excursion.</p>
<p>Gradually the Pavilion became despoiled of its costly
furniture and fittings, many of the latter being ruthlessly torn
down and destroyed.&nbsp; Eventually it was announced that the
building was to be razed to the ground, the materials sold, and
the land disposed of for building purposes.&nbsp; In November,
1848, it became known that the Royal Commissioners of the Woods
and Forests intended to introduce a Bill the next Sessions of
Parliament, for the sale of the property, to obtain funds for
further improvements at Buckingham Palace.&nbsp; The Town
Commissioners put in their claim for a restoration by the Crown
of the road which formerly went through the Pavilion Grounds,
from south to north from East Street.&nbsp; It was also pointed
out that some portions of the ground that had been sold to the
Prince Regent, had restrictions against building, which
restrictions could not be removed without the consent of the
Lords of the Manor.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>The
Bill for the disposal, however, passed, and on the 27th of July,
1849, a Vestry meeting of the rated inhabitants, determined upon
purchasing the property for &pound;53,000, the sum required for
it by the Commissioners of the Woods and Forests.&nbsp; Another
Bill had yet to be obtained to give the Town Commissioners power
to purchase the estate.&nbsp; Such an opposition to the purchase
in the meantime sprung up amongst some of the ratepayers, and at
a Vestry meeting called to approve of the Bill, that, after two
days&rsquo; polling, the amendment, in effect &ldquo;that the
purchase be stopped,&rdquo; was only lost by a minority of 36,
the numbers being: for the purchase, 1343; against it,
1307.&nbsp; The Bill was read in the House of Commons a second
time, without opposition, on the 14th of February, 1850; and was
read a third time in the House of Lords on the 2nd of May,
1850.&nbsp; The money for the purchase, and &pound;7,000 for the
expenses of obtaining the Bill, and to restore the building,
amounting in the whole to &pound;60,000, was borrowed of the Bank
of England, and on the 13th of June, 1850, the Commissioners of
the Woods and Forests were paid the sum required.&nbsp; The
building is not yet wholly appropriated, but, immediately upon
the completion of the purchase, the late Mr. Christopher Wren
Vick was employed to effect the work of restoration, and he
succeeded in obtaining the original blocks from which the former
paper-hangings of the grand suite of rooms were printed, and also
in engaging Mr. Lambelet,&mdash;who has since died in
poverty&mdash;the artist who executed the original
decorations.&nbsp; On the 21st of January, 1851, the Pavilion was
reopened with a grand ball of the inhabitants; since which time
numerous balls, concerts, and meetings of scientific, benevolent,
and other societies have taken place there, and it has now an
excellent gallery for paintings, and several rooms have been set
apart for the Brighton Museum, an institution that is well
deserving of support.&nbsp; Paintings, by purchase and gifts,
adorn many of the walls of the building, and in the Vestibule and
Chinese Gallery are some excellent specimens of sculpture,
principally by our local sculptor, Mr. Pepper.&nbsp; The most
prominent is a full length statue by Noble, of the late Captain
Pechell, son of the late member for Brighton, Sir G. R. B.
Pechell, Bart.&nbsp; The gallant young officer fell during the
Russian War, in the Crimea.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>Besides the Pavilion and Grounds, the estate has many
private houses, including the magnificent range called Pavilion
Buildings.&nbsp; The debt consequent upon the purchase is being
gradually reduced, and the opponents to the purchase not feeling
the burthen which they dreaded, have the gratification of
knowing, that, as a lung to their magnificent town, they have
that which no other town in the kingdom possesses,&mdash;an
extensive park of its own in its very centre.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XXVII.<br />
ON AND ABOUT THE RACE-COURSE.</h2>
<p>Royalty had scarcely taken up its abode in Brighton, when,
according to the Racing Calendar, in 1783, racing commenced its
career on the eastern down, better known as White Hawk Down,
Brighton.&nbsp; The sports were principally amongst the officers
of the Militia Regiments which were then quartered in the town,
and they received the patronage of the Prince of Wales.&nbsp;
Beyond the authority of the &ldquo;Oldest Inhabitant,&rdquo;
transmitted orally, there is no account of the extent, formation,
or the tenure of the course.&nbsp; It is understood to have been
about two miles in length, and to have occupied, as at present,
the horse shoe shaped ridge of the hill, and was defined, on
sufferance, by the clearing away of the furze.</p>
<p>The Race Ground proper consists of 105 acres and 30 perches,
over which the right of pasturage has become vested in the
Marquis of Bristol, by purchase from Mr. Thomas Read Kemp, who
bought it for &pound;780, subject to public rights, as the
erection thereon, by the inhabitants, of booths and stalls for
the accommodation and recreation of the public during the
races.&nbsp; The Course is two miles in length, and what is known
as the New Course is one mile long.&nbsp; The counterpart of an
alleged lease was in the possession of Mr. Thomas Attree,
Queen&rsquo;s <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>Park, bearing date June 24th, 1796, purporting to be a
demise of the Race Stand to various inhabitants,&mdash;all of
whom are now deceased,&mdash;for 99 years, at the annual rent of
one guinea.&nbsp; The counterpart came into the possession of Mr.
Attree in 1822, many years prior to which no rent had been paid
or demanded, and no lease could ever be discovered.&nbsp; On the
2nd July, 1846, a committee of the Town Commissioners were
informed by Mr. Attree that he claimed the Stand for himself and
others who had subscribed &pound;400 for its erection, in
eighteen shares, whereof he held nine, and that the sum still
remained a charge upon the building; but he offered to sell the
Stand for &pound;400 to the Race Committee.&nbsp; The Committee
considering that no valid lease was in existence,&mdash;inasmuch
as in deeds, dated 1822, and to which Mr Attree was a party;
whereby the Race Stand was specially granted, no allusion
whatever was made to a lease or other incumbrance,&mdash;declined
the offer.&nbsp; They furthermore considered that the debt
alleged to be due and charged thereon ought long since to have
been liquidated from the proceeds of the letting, and that the
inhabitants beneficially interested therein were exonerated from
such debt, charge, or encumbrance.</p>
<p>In 1849 a new Race Committee was formed, and their first step
was to purchase the Stand, giving for it, to the surviving
shareholders, Mr. T. Attree, Mr. H. Blackman, and Mr. Tamplin,
the sum of &pound;360, the London, Brighton, and South-Coast
Railway Company liberally presenting to the Committee &pound;100
towards the amount, independent of their annual subscription to
the Race Fund of &pound;200.&nbsp; The following six gentlemen
also came forward as Trustees: Mr. Alderman Burrows, Mr. Alderman
Martin, Mr. Robert Williams, Mr. H. F. Stocken, Mr. Lewis Slight,
and Mr. Lewis Slight, jun., and the shabby wooden building,
erected in 1798, gave place to the present commodious and
handsome structure, the design of Mr. Allan Stickney, the Town
Surveyor, at a cost of &pound;5,000, the whole of which has been
discharged by the Race Committee, who have likewise increased the
public money from &pound;350 given in 1848, to nearly
&pound;2,000 annually.</p>
<p>The old Race Stand, built in 1803, succeeded the first
building, which was erected in 1788, and destroyed by fire on the
23rd of <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>August, 1796.&nbsp; The fire arose in consequence of
the carelessness of the family who had been permitted to occupy
the building.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the unfortunate occurrence
took place about mid-day, it was distinctly seen at a distance of
upwards of thirty miles.&nbsp; Many people from various parts of
the county, some on horseback, and some on foot, entered the town
during the succeeding night and day, to make enquiries respecting
it, as apprehensions prevailed that the enemy had made a descent
on that part of the coast, and was evincing his love for the
natives by setting fire to their dwellings.</p>
<p>A singular incident occurred during the fire: An officer of
the Prince&rsquo;s regiment, attracted to the spot by the volumes
of flame and smoke, was reviewing the terrific encroachments of
the devouring element, when a cat, dreadfully singed and
terrified, sprung through the blaze, and alighted on his
shoulders.&nbsp; The officer, somewhat surprised, at first
endeavoured to shake her off; but poor puss, firmly fixing her
claws in his jacket, was not so easily got rid of.&nbsp;
Perceiving, then, her reluctance to leave him, he at length
humanely determined, that as she had, in the moment of danger and
fear, flown to him for protection, she should accompany him to
the Barracks, where she was well taken care of by her new master
and his comrades.</p>
<p>A curious circumstance took place on the morning of the Races,
August 4th, 1805.&nbsp; The farmer who rented the race ground
having explained to the Jockey Club that he had not received the
usual compliment of the fourth of a pipe of wine for the previous
season, threatened to plough up the course if he was not paid
what he conceived to be his due.&nbsp; Accordingly, he set his
plough to work, but a press-gang appearing in sight, his
ploughman fled, and resigned the course to the gentlemen of the
turf, the farmer the while declaring that he would not be
jockeyed out of his wine, as he would have a sort of a race for
it in Westminster Hall.&nbsp; The cause, however, never came
off.</p>
<p>The support given to the Brighton Races by the Prince of Wales
and those immediately about him, made the meeting amongst the
nobility quite a national feature, as the <i>elite</i> of the
turf were always in attendance, and a gaiety prevailed that no
other place could boast of.&nbsp; The course was thronged with
equestrians and the <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>fashionable equipages of the day,
barouches and four, driven by lords and baronets.&nbsp;
Conspicuous amongst them was His Royal Highness on his German
Waggon&mdash;as his barouche was called,&mdash;driving his six
bays, with Townsend, of Bow Street, as his companion, as well to
protect the Prince from insult as from robbery.&nbsp; But it was
a position which gave His Royal Highness an opportunity to
practise upon his guardian a somewhat unpleasant joke.&nbsp;
Turning suddenly towards Townsend, just at the termination of a
race, he exclaimed, &ldquo;By Jove, Townsend, I&rsquo;ve been
robbed; I had with me some damson tarts, but they are now
gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; said Townsend, rising,
&ldquo;impossible!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined the
Prince, &ldquo;and you are the purloiner,&rdquo; at the same time
taking from the seat whereon the officer had been sitting, the
crushed crust of the asserted missing tarts, and adding,
&ldquo;This is a sad blot upon your reputation as a vigilant
officer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather, say your Royal Highness, a
sad stain upon my escutcheon,&rdquo; added Townsend, raising the
gilt buttoned tails of his blue coat and exhibiting the
fruit-stained seat of his nankeen inexpressibles.</p>
<p>The Brighton Races are now held on the Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday following the Goodwood meeting.&nbsp; Thursday is
devoted to the racing of the Brighton Race Club, established in
1850.&nbsp; Formerly they were either on Saturday, Monday, and
Tuesday, as shown by the calendar of the Brighton Races, July
28th, 30th, and 31st, 1804, now in the possession of Mr. Alderman
Martin; or, as in 1810, on Friday, Saturday, and Monday, August
3rd, 4th, and 6th, when two races a day took place, distinguished
in their time of running by &ldquo;Before Dinner,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;After Dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The arrangement of the days was
to admit of a fair, termed &ldquo;White Hawk Fair,&rdquo; being
held on the east down on the intervening Sunday.&nbsp; It has now
been abolished about forty years.&nbsp; The <i>Morning
Herald</i>, Sunday, August 2nd, 1807, makes the following mention
of this fair:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>White Hawk Fair, as it is termed, has attracted
much company to the Race Down to-day, though but few individuals
of fashionable note were to be seen in the throng.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connected with this Down is the</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">LEGEND OF THE WHITE
HAWK LADY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Less than half a century since, the remnant of a moss-covered
<a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>unhewn
stone marked the spot in Ovingdean churchyard, where, as gossips
then said, were deposited the remains of Margaret Ladrone,
probably a name conferred on her from the pilfering propensities
of the gipsies, a tribe to which she belonged, though she was
familiarly spoken of as &ldquo;Mag Lade,&rdquo; a sybil or
fortune-teller of her day, whose visits to Ovingdean were annual
in the month of August, on the occasion of White Hawk Fair, a
holiday gathering on White Hawk Down, at which the rustics were
wont to learn their fate of the wise woman, as she was termed by
the unmarried who would know the future through the vista of
happiness; but the old crone or witch, by those whose stern
thought attributed all the mishaps that befel either themselves
or their substance to the influence of an evil one, with whom she
was proclaimed to be in league.&nbsp; At other periods of the
year she practised her vocation in various places throughout the
county, so that she had a regular circuit, through the course of
which the burning fervour of youth hailed her advent with earnest
anticipations, equalled only by the dread entertained by mature
age, that blight and murrain were her attendants.&nbsp; It
happened on one occasion, the date whereof is immaterial, that
Editha Elmore, the only daughter of the rich squire of
Woodingdean, while intent on the palmistry of Mag,&mdash;whose
hand she had crossed with a broad silver piece,&mdash;by chance
cast her eyes upon the form of a dark young man of goodly mien,
the very type of him whom the gipsey prophetess essayed to be her
future husband.&nbsp; In the next country-dance he was her
partner, and also the envy of one who, from their childhood, had
been her companion, and was looked upon by the parents of each as
her intended bridegroom.&nbsp; The festivities of the day closed;
the dark stranger bade her adieu; the villagers returned to their
homes; and ere the shades of night had gathered over the Downs,
not a vestige was left of the scene which had been one of general
festivity.&nbsp; Ralph Mascall, the son of the farmer at the
Grange, Ovingdean, as had been his custom from a child,
accompanied the fair Editha to Woodingdean, where he received the
accustomed welcome of her parents; and, before midnight, he was
on his way homewards somewhat disturbed in mind that he had a
rival.&nbsp; His visits, however, to Squire Elmore&rsquo;s were
not the less frequent; nor did the <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>affection shown towards him by
Editha in the least appear to wane.&nbsp; And so another year
passed on, and the annual festival again arrived.&nbsp; There
again was Mag, whom Editha sought once more, to learn her
destiny.&nbsp; The Fates had not altered their decree; and there,
as twelve months since he stood, was the dark comely
stranger.&nbsp; The very type of previous years were the
proceedings of the day; the same homely village simplicity, the
jocund song, the rustic dance, the same potations of home-brewed
and cider; the same greetings, the same partings.&nbsp; Somewhat
later than was considered within the bounds of prudence, the
handmaid of Editha, accompanied by Giles, her lover, approached
the wicket that opened on the lawn before Squire Elmore&rsquo;s
mansion, where she was met by the dark stranger of the Fair, who,
tendering her a golden coin,&mdash;by way of hush
money,&mdash;bade her convey to her young mistress a note of
delicate proportions.&nbsp; Promise of secrecy was exacted; the
parting kiss was exchanged between the blushing Abigail and
Giles; and the latter accepting the companionship of the
stranger, the two bent their steps to Rottingdean, where the
honest rustic returned to his home.&nbsp; Where the stranger
rested for the night has never transpired.&nbsp; Early the
following morning Mag was at the mansion, the domestics of which,
anxious to learn how they were ruled by the stars, parted freely
with their silver pieces.&nbsp; The Abigail of the previous
night&rsquo;s adventure was particularly anxious to learn her
destiny; and the truth which was essayed of her Giles, his age,
his complexion, his temper, and his prospects, gave full
assurance of the marvellousness of Mag&rsquo;s divining skill, to
which the fair Editha, with whom she also had an interview, gave
implicit credence.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty hours, however, wrought
a great change at the mansion, and likewise in the hamlet of
Ovingdean.&nbsp; A more than usual oppression and sultriness
pervaded the atmosphere throughout the day, and towards nightfall
the war of elements commenced, the sharp flashes of lightning
increasing in vividness, the artillery of the heavens roaring in
awful solemnity, and the massive clouds discharging their
drenching cataracts.&nbsp; Such a night had never been previously
known in the neighbourhood; and every person anxiously waited the
coming dawn to learn the havoc of the dreadful storm.&nbsp; The
inmates of the mansion were early stirring, and, much <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>sooner than
usual, Mr. and Mrs. Elmore were at breakfast.&nbsp; But they had
not been long seated when they were informed that Miss Editha
could nowhere be found, and that by the appearance of her
bed-chamber she had not retired to rest during the night.&nbsp;
The note which had been delivered by the stranger, and was then
lying on the dressing table, appointing a midnight interview upon
the Downs, was all that could be found to account for her
absence.&nbsp; The most diligent search of the premises and the
plantation contiguous was immediately made, and a dispatch
without delay was sent off to Ovingdean, in the hopes that
tidings might be heard of her there; but all was fruitless.&nbsp;
Previous, however, to the news reaching that village, upon
passing by the church, the sexton discovered, in the south-west
corner of the burial ground, the charred remains of a female,
which, upon examination of the dress about them, were declared to
be those of old Margaret Ladrone.&nbsp; At the place were they
were found, there in the course of the day, were they interred,
without any funeral rites, and the stone, before referred to, was
placed over them to mark the spot.&nbsp; The dark stranger was
never afterwards seen.</p>
<p>The story continues, that, every stormy night after, the
figure of a lady in white paced the White Hawk Down, and that
always on the morning after the figure was seen, a foot-print,
cloven like that of an ox, was found at the same particular
spot.&nbsp; The <i>Morning Herald</i>, of July 17th, 1807, has
the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Brighton.&mdash;A few days ago were
dug up upon the slope of the Downs to the north-east of this
place, the bones of a woman, which, from their position, clearly
evinced that they had been deposited there many years before,
without ceremony.&nbsp; A singular rumour is now afloat of a
young person having been ravished and murdered there, by a person
of unsuspected character.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be proper to add
that since the finding of these bones the White Hawk Lady has not
walked abroad.&nbsp; The Elmore and the Mascall families, after
the mysterious disappearance of Editha, removed to Brighton; but
it is a very singular fact that the name of Lade is now very
common at Ovingdean, it being even that of the Sexton of the
parish, who is a descendant of Sir John Lade, spoken of in the
last Chapter.&nbsp; As, however, the church register dates back
only as far <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>as the year 1700, the genealogy of the family, even if
it did come through Old Mag, cannot be more remotely traced.</p>
<p>The death of the Earl of Egremont, who was a great patron of
the Brighton sports long after Royalty had abandoned contending
on the course, was a severe blow to Brighton Races; added to
which, the Duke of Richmond, a warm supporter of the turf,
withdrew his influence in favour of Goodwood.&nbsp; Year by year
the Races waned, with the prospect of an early dissolution,
which, on the withdrawal of the Queen&rsquo;s Plate, in 1849,
seemed inevitable.&nbsp; Persons, it is true, continued, as of
yore, to journey in from the country to witness them, but there
was a continual falling off in the attendance of the aristocracy,
and a rage for gambling of a most pernicious character, in
thimble-rig, roulette, Brunswick lottery, prick-in-the-garter,
&amp;c., having set in, the townspeople with-held the
subscriptions which they had been accustomed to grant pretty
freely to the races, as they found that instead of having an
equivalent for their money in sport, they were only paying a
premium for the encouragement and dissemination of vice.&nbsp;
Eventually, legislation put a stop to the nefarious proceedings
of the gamblers; and, in the very nick of time, the great modern
civilizer, the railway, was inducted from London, to give an
impetus to the prosperity of the town, which had perceptibly
declined when the Queen gave a preference over Brighton to the
Isle of Wight, for a marine retreat.&nbsp; The Railway was the
turning medium for the resuscitation of the Brighton Races, and
the new Race Committee promptly and successfully availed
themselves of it, as it opened the prospect of a new class of
supporters, in the inhabitants of the metropolis, who were by it
within two hours&rsquo; distance of the course.</p>
<p>At various periods since 1783, when troops were first
stationed at Brighton,&mdash;in consequence of the Pavilion
becoming a Royal residence,&mdash;reviews and sham fights of the
military have taken place on the Downs contiguous to the Race
Course, the spot being admirably adapted for army tactics.&nbsp;
The troops upon such occasions have been generally of the line
and the militia regiments quartered at the several Infantry
Barracks in the town, and at the Cavalry Barracks on the Lewes
Road, other regiments at Ringmer, Lewes, and East Blatchington
marching in to take part in the evolutions.&nbsp; <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>The Cavalry
Barracks were completed in 1795.&nbsp; In 1801 a range of stables
was erected, for the reception of 400 horses, immediately in
front of the main buildings, and abutting on the east boundary
wall contiguous to the Lewes Road; but in 1818 these stables were
removed, and the spacious grounds were thrown open to public
view.&nbsp; The fives-court, between the wings, in the centre of
the back court-yard, was erected in 1810, by the officers of the
Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars.</p>
<p>The modern grand military features of the Race Hill have been
the sham fights of the Volunteers, and known as the Battle of
Ovingdean, Easter Monday, April 1st, 1861, under Lord Ranelagh;
and the Battle of White Hawk Down, Easter Monday, April 21st,
1862, under Lord Clyde; both great successes, and affording
proofs of the valuable services and admirable efficiency of this
noble auxiliary of England&rsquo;s military power.&nbsp; The
force present on the first occasion numbered between 7,000 and
8,000 men, thus brigaded:&mdash;</p>

<p>The troops were formed in battalions on the Level, from whence
they marched by way of Marine Parade, and by the County Hospital
to the summit of the hill on the right of the Race Course, <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>along
which, past the Grand Stand, they marched in review, before Major
General Sir James Scarlett and his staff.</p>
<p>Upon the crown of this hill, during the wars with Napoleon,
stood a signal-house and telegraph semaphore communicating along
the coast with similar stations at Seaford and Shoreham, and
forming a link in the important chain of signals which was in use
between Portsmouth and Dover.&nbsp; There is very little doubt,
that about that locality at a much earlier date than sporting
records hand down to us, racing of some description took place,
the Town Book having the following entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Memorandum, that on ye 7th of November, 1713,
Henry May, Esq., paid us a half-penny acknowledgmt for carrying
the Corpes of his father Sr Richard May, deceased, through the
Laine, commonly called the Hilly Laine, from the place were

</blockquote>
<p>The payment was doubtless exacted under the erroneous notion
that the unobstructed conveyance of a corpse gave the public a
right to the way or road along which the body was borne; and it
is the generally received opinion that the right of road by the
footpath or bridle-way from Blatchington, by way of Watts&rsquo;s
Laundry to the road on Church Hill, was obtained by a corpse
having been conveyed from Blatchington for burial in the
church-yard of St. Nicholas, Brighton.</p>
<p>The several corps engaged in the Review having passed up the
Course took up heir first position on the ridge of heights
overlooking Brighton, and afterwards formed an extended line on
the crest of one of the hills running inland and parallel with
the race-hill.&nbsp; This long line of about a mile in length was
supported by four guns on the extreme left.&nbsp; At the time of
commencing operations the furze on the side of the hill was,
either by design or accident, set on fire.&nbsp; Huge volumes of
smoke rose from the burning gorse, and as the line opened and
kept up a heavy firing for some time, the imaginative spectators
on the distant eminence might suppose that some quiet hamlet had
been set on fire, either by the enemy or by the brave defenders
of their hearths and homes.&nbsp; After some very heavy
file-firing <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>from right of companies, and two or three
well-delivered volleys, the line fell back, protected in its
retreat by the guns in position.&nbsp; The enemy was supposed to
have followed them, but, like the Spanish fleet, they could not
be seen, because they were not in sight.&nbsp; Lord
Ranelagh&rsquo;s force was too small to admit of division into
two forces; but even had it been larger, it is doubtful whether a
Volunteer enemy would submit to be beaten according to orders,
with so much cheerfulness, and with so much steadiness, as is the
case with the regulars on the field-days of Aldershot and
elsewhere.&nbsp; The retreating force next deployed towards the
sea, the action became more general, and several battalions were
moved up in support of the line.&nbsp; There were more rattles of
musketry, and more volleys, and then, wearied out with the
persistence of the enemy, two brigades, forming the right,
charged down on the enemy&rsquo;s left and drove them over hill
and dale.&nbsp; The unseen and flying enemy, however, got some
imaginary reinforcements, and returned to the attack and
retrieved their laurels.&nbsp; The gallant brigadiers led back
their unwilling, but not disheartened men on the left wing; then
the centre fell back, and the right, unable to stand alone,
followed the example.&nbsp; Lord Ranelagh&rsquo;s eye instantly
saw the cloud of dust which told of the approach of
horsemen.&nbsp; Quick as lightning there went forth the
command&mdash;&ldquo;Form square to receive cavalry,&rdquo; and
the order was promptly obeyed; and had there been any cavalry,
they would no doubt have been very warmly and heartily received,
in obedience to orders.&nbsp; The division took up a fresh
position&mdash;again advanced&mdash;the Battle of Ovingdean was
fought and won, and the well-known strains of the &ldquo;National
Anthem&rdquo; told of the loyalty, as many courageous deeds had
told of the valour, of the Volunteers.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the various corps, they were marched to
their several places of rendezvous, on the Level, St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church and North Steine Enclosures, the Pavilion
Grounds, and the Steine, where they partook of
refreshments.&nbsp; At 11 o&rsquo;clock the
&ldquo;assembly&rdquo; was sounded, and very soon after the whole
of the corps were on their march to the Race Hill, by way of the
Marine Parade and Elm Grove, the Divisions meeting again in White
Hawk Valley, whence they paraded down the Course and passed in
Review opposite the Grand Stand, before Lord Clyde, the Earl of
Chichester&mdash;Lord Lieutenant of the County,&mdash;and Lord
Cardigan, passing out at the south end of the Course, and then
descending to their original position in the Valley.&nbsp; The
field evolutions took place principally on White Hawk Down, and
were eminently successful, and the whole of the arrangements of
the day, civil and military, were a practical demonstration of
the facility with which troops might be moved towards a
threatened point on the particular railway which would be most
likely to be required for such a duty in an actual case of
emergency.&nbsp; On the morning of the Review, 6,922 Volunteers
were despatched from London Bridge in two hours and 41 minutes,
and 5,170 from the Victoria Station in two hours and 20 minutes,
without difficulty.&nbsp; They were conveyed in 16 trains, each
composed of an engine and tender and 22 vehicles, and each
carrying on an average 20 officers and 735 men; and they <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>reached
Brighton in an average of 2 hours and 28 minutes from the time of
starting.&nbsp; The Brighton Company borrowed on this occasion 72
carriages from three neighbouring companies, and 79 carriages
also brought Volunteers over their railway, from other lines; but
they had to provide for their ordinary passenger-traffic on that
day, as well as for the Easter Monday traffic to the Crystal
Palace, which was very considerable, and to convey upwards of
2,000 Volunteers along the south coast from the several stations
on their own line.&nbsp; Indeed, the total number of passengers
who travelled upon the London, Brighton, and South-Coast Railway
on that day was 132,202, including Volunteers and the holders of
season and return tickets.</p>
<p>As a proof that the Queen takes a deep interest in the
Volunteer movement, Her Majesty, several times during the day,
telegraphed to be informed of every special incident in connexion
with the military evolutions.&nbsp; Happily no accident happened
to mar the general proceedings; but, to meet any casualty that
might have arisen, Brigade Surgeon Burrows of the First Sussex
Volunteer Artillery, issued a notice that every convenience for
temporary hospital purposes was provided in a tent to the west of
the Race Stand, in a tent at the south of the battle-field, and
at the Industrial Schools.</p>
<p>The Industrial Schools are built upon what is known as the
Warren Farm, which occupies an area of ten acres of arable land
immediately north-east of the Race Course, and was purchased for
&pound;2,000.&nbsp; The project of erecting these Schools for the
purpose of training poor children to habits of industry and
relieving them of the ban of pauperism, was first entertained by
the Board of Guardians, in 1853, but no steps were taken to carry
it out till it received the sanction of the Vestry in 1856; and
even then, from time to time, numerous impediments arose, in the
selection of plans and in borrowing the requisite money of
Government, so that the first stone of the building was not laid
till the 26th of March, 1859, the plans selected being those of
Mr. George Maynard, the Parish Surveyor.&nbsp; Mr. John Fabian,
of Brighton, was the builder, at a contract price of
&pound;8,223, the sum of &pound;5,269 having previously been
expended in forming roads, and necessary incidental work.&nbsp;
On the 1st of <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>December, 1859, Mr. Fabian, as stipulated, completed
his task, and delivered over the building to the Board of
Guardians.&nbsp; Subsequently, Mr. Fabian erected the farm
buildings at the cost of &pound;1,514 16s, and Messrs. Patching
and Son erected the boundary wall for &pound;560.</p>
<p>An establishment to consist of more than 300 persons would of
necessity require a good supply of one of the chief elements of
existence, water; it therefore became a question with the
Guardians, how that supply was to be obtained, whether by sinking
a well, and thus have their own source of the element, or by
having pipes laid on from the Brighton Water Works.&nbsp; The
Guardians decided upon, the former course, as, having it in
contemplation to erect a new Workhouse on a seven acre piece of
land, which they had purchased for that purpose, between the
Reservoir and the Race Hill, their own well would supply both
establishments,&mdash;hence was projected the Warren Farm Well,
the fame of which has spread to all parts of the civilized
world.</p>
<p>This celebrated well was commenced on the 25th of March, 1858;
but at the depth of 418 feet 3 inches, where a heading was driven
laterally, a contract which had been entered into with Mr. North
was abandoned, and the Board, after a consultation, determined to
proceed with the work themselves, and commenced by driving
another heading opposite the former, at a depth of 421 feet 9
inches, and from this a second perpendicular shaft, four feet in
diameter, was dug, the superintendence of the labour being
entrusted to Mr. Isaac Huggett, who persevered unremittingly with
the work, and eventually, after surmounting innumerable
difficulties, found on Sunday, the 16th March, 1862, at a depth
of 1,285 feet, so abundant a supply of excellent water, that in a
few days there were more than 200,000 gallons of that pure
beverage in the well.</p>
<p>To celebrate the success of the undertaking, Mr. Henry Catt, a
Guardian, entertained the whole of the members of the Board, with
the Vicar, and their Officers, and likewise Mr. Huggett and his
men, at a dinner at the Town Hall, 120 guests sitting down to the
repast under the presidency of the delighted liberal donor, Mr.
Churchwarden Marchant and Mr. Alderman Brigden occupying the
vice-chairs.&nbsp; As a memento, also, of the happy event, Mr.
Catt had <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>silver medals struck by Mr. Norris, jeweller, West
Street, one of which was given to each man who had worked in the
Well.&nbsp; The medals bore the inscription: &ldquo;By the
blessing of God, on hard work, patience, and perseverance,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Warren Farm Well, Brighton.&nbsp; Water found, March
16th, 1862.&rdquo;&nbsp; The medal presented to Mr. Huggett was
of gold.</p>
<p>Immediately consequent upon finding water for the
establishment, was the completion of the furnishing of the
building and obtaining the requisite staff of officers; and on
Thursday, August 14th, 1862, the Institution being ready for
occupation, the juvenile portion of the inmates of the Workhouse,
77 boys and 65 girls, were removed thither under the care of the
Industrial Schools&rsquo; Committee, many other of the Guardians
and their friends taking part in the procession, which was headed
by the Industrial School band.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Sattin, the
Governor and Matron of the Workhouse, also accompanied them to
deliver over their youthful charge to Mr. and Mrs. Hales, the
Superintendents of the Schools.&nbsp; The occupation of the
Industrial Schools is at present the last public feature of the
Race Hill and adjacent Downs.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XXVIII.<br />
PAST AND PRESENT PASTIMES.</h2>
<p>Fickleness in the habits of civilized nations is in no manner
more clearly exemplified than in the pastimes of the people; for
although many sports are characterised as national, and are of
great antiquity, modernization has greatly destroyed their
originality, and refinement has detracted from the natural
enjoyment of them.&nbsp; Even in the rural districts of England,
Harvest Home possesses but little of the rustic homeliness and
jollity of yore, and the happy season of Christmas lacks the
&ldquo;Squires of Old,&rdquo; and the festivities and the freely
dispensed bounties of the Baronial Halls.&nbsp; In towns,
especially those which come under the denomination fashionable,
<a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>there is
a constant revolution in the &ldquo;rounds of
amusements.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brighton has been particularly prominent
in this respect, a vast variety having run its course during the
past century.</p>
<p>Without doubt the Toy Fair, now in a wretched state of
decadence, was the earliest people&rsquo;s festival.&nbsp; It was
formerly held on the Cliff, between Ship Street and Black-Lion
Street; but the town increasing and the Fair assuming a
corresponding magnitude, Belle Vue field, whereon now stands
Regency Square, was its location.&nbsp; From thence it was
translated to the Level, where, on the 4th of September, 1807, a
Sheep Fair was first held, notification of the same having been
in the <i>Brighton Herald</i>, and in the <i>Weekly Journal</i>,
published at Lewes, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The rapid strides which agriculture has made
within the last ten years, in this country, and the extreme
utility which has been the result of its present scientific mode
of practice, has commanded the attention and admiration not only
of all England, but of all civilised Europe.&nbsp; To those who
are interested in the purchase of any particular breed of stock,
it must be of extreme importance that their stock be
<i>genuine</i> and uncontaminated.</p>
<p>To fix, therefore, a spot where a pure unmixed breed shall
always be produced, and where the purchaser (who perhaps comes
from a distance) shall be sure of unadulterated stock, appears to
be a great desideratum.&nbsp; In no instance is it more so than
in that useful and highly productive animal, the South Down
Sheep.&nbsp; Those who possess this breed, true and genuine, have
had much reason to lament that at fairs, where a great variety of
sheep are brought to market, many are sold for South Down Sheep
which have no pretensions to be so called; and which afterwards
not answering the purpose of the buyers, bring unmerited disgrace
on such as are really genuine.&nbsp; We, therefore, the
undersigned breeders of true South Down Sheep, have come to a
resolution to establish a Fair, to be holden on Brighton Level,
the 4th of September, 1807.&nbsp; And we pledge ourselves to
bring to it genuine South Down Tups, Stock Ewes, Ewe Lambs, and
Wether Lambs; and moreover we will not, knowingly, either
ourselves introduce, or suffer to be introduced to this Fair any
but what shall be of the <i>genuine</i> and <i>true</i> South
Down breed:</p>

<p>About 20,000 prime South Down sheep of all denominations found
a ready sale, buyers being plentiful.&nbsp; That year, on the
same day, the general Fair was held on the Marlborough Steine,
the southernmost of the present North Steine Enclosures, where
gingerbread stalls, whirligigs, and roundabouts were in
abundance.&nbsp; The next year the Sheep Fair was equally well
attended; but notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions of its
promoters, it had but an existence of four years.&nbsp; A Cattle
Market was established on a piece of the Parish Ground on the
Church Hill, adjoining the West Hill Estate, in 1831.&nbsp; Like
the Sheep Fair, however, it had but a few years&rsquo; duration,
there being no meadows near for the accommodation of stock.&nbsp;
The Corn Market, by sample, is held every Thursday, at the King
and Queen Inn, in a spacious and commodious room.&nbsp; From the
Level, where Gully and Cribb, on the 11th of August, 1807, in the
presence of the Prince of Wales and his Royal Brothers, had a
sparring match, the town authorities eventually ejected the
Spring and Autumn pleasure Fair, which has since sought refuge
upon any available spot contiguous.&nbsp; A few years more and it
will be amongst the things of the past.</p>
<p>The Level has at various periods been the arena for the
festivals in celebration of important national events, as on the
19th July, 1821, upon the occasion of the coronation of George
IV., when two bullocks were roasted whole, and distributed hot,
and four, previously dressed, were served out, the expenses being
defrayed by a public subscription.&nbsp; The roasting of the two
bullocks commenced on the preceding night, when partial fires <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>were
kindled to heat the carcasses through the thickest part.&nbsp;
But about five o&rsquo;clock in the morning the real roasting
commenced.&nbsp; The grates were then piled high with blazing
fuel, and a savoury vapour spread through the atmosphere.&nbsp;
About six, one of the spits, a stout scaffold pole, gave way
under its ponderous weight, but at the expense only of an
additional spar, and a score or so of blistered fingers.</p>
<p>The work of carving commenced shortly after two o&rsquo;clock,
when Mr. Thomas Palmer, the King&rsquo;s cutler, in a waggon
converted into a suitable platform for such a display, decorated
with devices and waving streamers, and containing several
hogsheads of ale, presented to Mr. John Vallance, the Chairman of
the Managing Committee, a carving knife and fork, and a
corkscrew, all of extensive dimensions, with the request that the
coronation beef might be carved with the former, and the bungs
extracted from the casks by the latter, and that they might be
furthermore preserved by the local authorities, for use on
similar occasions.&nbsp; The work of carving occupied about an
hour, during which time many thousands of persons partook of the
hot and the cold.</p>
<p>At this period there lived in a hut of very rude construction,
consisting of but one room, on the southern incline of Round
Hill, Corporal Staines, an old marine who served under Nelson at
the siege of Copenhagen.&nbsp; He was very crippled, and obtained
his living by exhibiting his miniature fortifications,
constructed by himself of chalk, the soldiers and cannons which
surmounted the battlements being likewise formed of chalk; as was
also a very rude model of the gallant ship, the Victory, bearing,
under a black canopy, a coffin containing the body of the Hero of
Trafalgar.&nbsp; Upon great national anniversaries and
festivities it was his custom to fire Royal salutes from four
pistol barrels which he had formed as a battery, and every day he
was accustomed to fire the sun-set gun.&nbsp; While the feast was
being made off the roasted oxen, the old corporal fired a Royal
salute, for which he was rewarded with a good substantial dinner
and a compliment of money, besides presents which were made him
by the holiday folk.&nbsp; Corporal Staines first took up his
abode at Brighton in a cavern hewn in the Church Hill chalk-pit,
the site&mdash;filled up,&mdash;of the east end of Upper North
Street.&nbsp; <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>Agreeing with his residence in the chalk-pit is the
following entry in the Vestry book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>October 2nd, 1809.&mdash;That Corporal Staines be
allowed a blanket and a great coat during the winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Staines removed from the chalk pit to a hut constructed by
himself, immediately east of the Manor Pound, then at the back of
the Parish Church, on the spot now occupied by the entrance of
the northern Burial Ground, contiguous to which were the Parish
Stocks, that were afterwards removed to the Market Place, in the
Bartholomews.&nbsp; Upon the re-building of the Market, the
Stocks were placed against its southern wall at the back of the
Thatched House Inn, where, after remaining a few years as a relic
of a barbarous age, they went to decay.&nbsp; In 1824, the Pound
was removed to the north-west corner of the Workhouse grounds, on
the Dyke Road.&nbsp; In course of time, however, it became
obsolete for the impounding of cattle, and in 1853 it was
purchased by the parish of the Lord of the Manor, for
&pound;100.&nbsp; For some years after his removal from Church
Hill, the old marine took up his abode in the east bank of the
pond at the junction of the old Shoreham and Ditchling Roads, on
Rose Hill; but when the ground adjacent was enclosed by Mr.
Colbatch, he translated himself to just without its eastern
boundary wall, on the incline of the hill which commands an
uninterrupted view of the Level and the Steine in general.&nbsp;
He ended his days in Brighton Workhouse.</p>
<p>The earliest town record of the Proclamation of a Sovereign is
a minute of Vestry, date, March 19th, 1701, which runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Israel Paine, Constable, being accompanyed with
the chief Inhabitants of the town (after open proclamation made
by the Cryer) did in the mercat place about Eleven of the clock
in the forenoon, solemnly proclaim our Gratious Sovereign Lady
<span class="smcap">Queen Anne</span>, Queen off England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland; upon which there followed great
shoutings and acclamations of all the people.&nbsp; Saying, <span
class="smcap">God Save Queen Anne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coronation of Her present Majesty was celebrated on the
Level, June 28th, 1838, in a similar manner to that of George
IV.&nbsp; The last occasion of public rejoicing there was to
commemorate the Peace with Russia in 1855.&nbsp; The great Peace
Festival, consequent upon the overthrow of the sovereignty of
Napoleon Bonaparte, on his retiring to Elba, took place on the
12th of August, 1814, on the <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>Prince Regent&rsquo;s Cricket
Ground, which occupied the extreme north of the Level,
immediately in front of the Peircy Alms Houses, Lewes Road.&nbsp;
The animated scene which the Cricket Ground presented on the
memorable occasion was, in the highest degree, interesting.&nbsp;
Seventy-five double rows of tables were formed, each in an oblong
square, open at the bottom only, and each adapted for the
accommodation of one hundred and twenty-two persons.&nbsp; These
were furnished in a plentiful manner, with true old English fare
of roast beef and plum puddings, garnished with a suitable number
of hogsheads of ale and brown stout, at convenient distances,
giving an air of hospitable importance to the whole.&nbsp; At
each table a president was appointed, with six assistants, under
the denomination of stewards; the former wearing white sashes,
with the inscription, &ldquo;Brighton Festival,&rdquo; and the
latter purple and white favours, bearing the number of the table
at which they were to officiate, affixed at the left
breast.&nbsp; Flags of blue silk, lettered in gold,
&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wellington,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Blucher,&rdquo; &amp;c., waved at the head of the various
tables, where were seated upwards of 7,000 persons.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock a bugle sounded from No. 1 table, at
which presided the Rev. J. Carr (Vicar), who rose and pronounced
the following benediction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O Thou who art the great God of Nations, Thou hast
filled our hearts with joy by the restoration of Peace and the
prospect of Plenty: we meet under the canopy of Heaven as members
of Thy family.&nbsp; May this Festival be crowned with Thy
blessing, and may our lives express the gratitude which Thy
goodness inspires, for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was repeated by Mr. Robert Ackerson (High Constable) at
the lower table, and by the Presidents of the other tables
severally, and then the busy scene of feasting commenced in the
presence of some thousands of spectators, who, in carriages,
waggons, carts, and caravans, took up their positions just
without the boundary rails.</p>
<p>The sound of the second bugle having announced the dinner at
an end, the Vicar rose and thus returned thanks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Merciful Father, our grateful hearts acknowledge
Thy goodness; may Charity ever assist the poor, and the poor
confess their infinite obligations unto Thee, as the Bountiful
Giver of all their blessings, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>The
following toasts and airs then succeeded, the Band of the 3rd
Buffs being in attendance and adding to the pleasures of the
fete:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Our Good Old King.&mdash;&ldquo;God Save the
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Prince Regent.&mdash;&ldquo;Rule
Britannia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Queen and Royal Family.&mdash;&ldquo;The
Brunswick March.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Duke of Wellington.&mdash;&ldquo;See the
Conquering Hero comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Allied Sovereigns.&mdash;&ldquo;The
March to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Louis XVIII.&mdash;&ldquo;Henri
Quatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">May Peace produce Plenty and Plenty
Gratitude.&mdash;&ldquo;Speed the Plough.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Prosperity and Unanimity to the Town of
Brighton.&mdash;&ldquo;Tight little Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The after part of the day was devoted to dancing,
blind-man&rsquo;s-buff, jingling matches, foot-racing,
stool-ball, kiss-in-the-ring, jumping in sacks, &amp;c.; and the
happy throng concluded the day by joining hands and forming long
chains of human beings, and thus in high glee they
&ldquo;threaded the tailor&rsquo;s needle&rdquo; to Castle
Square, where, after singing &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo;
they, in the most orderly manner, dispersed, and made for their
several homes.</p>
<p>Cricket was a favourite pastime with the Prince of Wales, who
was frequently engaged in the manly game with the noblemen and
gentlemen of his suite, on the Royal Ground, which had been
granted for his use by Mr. Thomas Reed Kemp, the Lord of the
Manor.&nbsp; His Royal Highness, however, upon coming to the
throne, retired from cricket, and hence the Ground was given
up.&nbsp; Mr. Kemp then made the grant of a portion of it to the
Town for the recreation of the inhabitants, and the road to the
north of the Level was formed.</p>
<p>In 1822, an enterprising townsman, Mr. James Ireland, became
the purchaser of ten acres of the land immediately north of the
road, and in the following year, Ireland&rsquo;s Gardens and
Cricket Ground were opened to the public.&nbsp; The original
entrance was at the south-west comer, where was a neat lodge that
conducted to the cricket ground, and an excellent bowling green,
with raised banks, and a billiard room with colonnade and rustic
seats in front.&nbsp; At the lower or east end was the tavern
department, the Hanover Arms Inn, where, also, was an excellent
fives&rsquo; court.&nbsp; The Gardens were approached either by
crossing the Cricket Ground, or by a separate road that skirted
the property.</p>
<p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Mr.
Ireland was the successor of Mr. Daniel Constable, who, with his
brother William as shopman, commenced May 29th, 1802, the drapery
business, now the well-known establishment of Messrs. Hannington
and Son, at No. 3, North Street.&nbsp; Mr. Ireland became the
purchaser of the business in 1806, and it passed from him to the
late Mr. Hannington, the successor also, at No. 4, of Mr. William
Diplock, who, in the summer of 1819, when Brighton churchyard was
despoiled of its dead, announced himself as sole agent for the
sale of patent metallic coffins, of the security of which he
assured the public, every person would be satisfied.&nbsp;
Previous to the formation of the Hanover Grounds, Mr. Ireland
carried on the business of woollen draper and undertaker at No.
10, North Street.</p>
<p>A noble and conspicuous building, comprising reading,
refreshment, and dressing rooms on the basement, and an elegant
promenade room, eighty feet by thirty feet, over them, formed the
junction of the Cricket Ground with the Gardens, just within the
entrance of which was the ladies&rsquo; bowling green, surrounded
by a beautiful lawn and tea arbours.&nbsp; There were likewise,
adjacent, an aviary and a grotto.&nbsp; A Gothic tower and
gateway approached by a bridge that spanned a piece of water at
the north end of the main central avenue, was the entrance to a
Maze, in the centre of which was a Merlin swing.&nbsp; From the
want of that support from the public which was due to Mr.
Ireland, for the spirit he evinced in so zealously catering for
their entertainment, the thousands which he expended were
entirely lost to him, and he retired from that which ought to
have been a benefit to the town and himself, a ruined man.</p>
<p>During the time that he held possession, a public declaration
was made by the town crier that a man would fly from the top of
the assembly room to the extreme north of the Grounds.&nbsp; All
Brighton was tickled by the announcement, and hours previous to
the time stated for the intended flight, throngs of people were
wending their way northward, and taking up their position, where
they imagined they could obtain the best view of the sight.&nbsp;
The Round Hill was covered with one mass of human beings, whose
eyes were concentrated upon a slight scaffold that was erected on
the roof of the building.&nbsp; From the top of this structure a
stout cable was stretched to the foot of the bridge at the maze,
affording <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>sufficient evidence that no hoax was intended.&nbsp;
Expectation, therefore, was on tip-toe; and after patience had
undergone a long endurance, a slightly-built man, in light
fleshings, with Zephyr-like wings, was seen to ascend the
scaffold, causing an universal clapping of hands, and the firing
of the guns at Staines&rsquo;s mimic fort.&nbsp; About a couple
of minutes sufficed for the performer to make the necessary
adjustments for his flight, and then, amidst loud huzzas, he,
waving a flag in each hand, gracefully glided down, head
foremost, beneath the cable, along which revolved an arrangement
of wheels, to which he was attached longitudinally.&nbsp; Those
who had a gratis view of the exploit smiled, and contented
themselves with the satisfaction that the sight had cost them
nothing; but those who went into the Gardens and paid, to see
whatever could be seen, felt sorely vexed, and some were so
excited as to attempt a castigation of the exhibitor.&nbsp; His
friends, however, quickly liberated him from his machinery, and
he took a flight through the maze that enabled him to elude his
pursuers.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Flying Man&rdquo; was Mr. William Constable, who,
on the disposal by his brother of his business to Mr. Ireland,
accompanied Daniel to America, where they devoted themselves to
scientific pursuits.&nbsp; His flying freak, on his return, was
as well for a scientific purpose as to benefit Mr. Ireland, and
the principle has been since applied in saving human life in
cases of fire and shipwreck.&nbsp; In 1841 he introduced the art
of photography, then called Daguerreotype, into Brighton, his
&ldquo;blue room&rdquo; being a very attractive feature on the
Marine Parade, near Atlingworth Street.&nbsp; He died on Sunday,
December 22nd, 1861.</p>
<p>Other speculators from time to time, with but little better
success than Mr. Ireland, tried their luck upon the estate.&nbsp;
Year by year showed the gradual decay which neglect engenders;
the buildings became dilapidated and unsafe for occupation, the
flowerbeds were transformed into a wilderness of weeds; and at
length, after having been made even the asylum for wild beasts,
and the arena for the dissoluteness of pleasure fairs, the
Gardens, that might have continued one of the chief prides of
Brighton, and the Cricket Ground&mdash;the fame of which is
perpetuated by Mason&rsquo;s celebrated print of the renowned
players of Sussex and Kent, and <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>their supporters,&mdash;the envy, as
it was, of other cricketing counties, were sacrificed to the
spirit of building, from the want of foresight in the
inhabitants, who now universally admit that both should have been
preserved to the town, as they were an establishment for the
people&rsquo;s amusement and recreation, with which nothing of
the kind in the county could compete.&nbsp; The present, the
Royal Brunswick Cricket Ground, kept by the veteran Box, is
capacious and well-formed; but it lacks the picturesqueness, and
the spectators have not the shelter from wind and rain, and the
shade from the trees which gave so vast a superiority to the
Hanover Ground.&nbsp; Previous to the formation of
Ireland&rsquo;s Gardens, some tea-gardens were in existence on
the Marine Parade, about the locality now occupied by Eaton
Place.&nbsp; They were merely a summer retreat for a cup of tea
during an afternoon stroll, and a place of call in winter for a
glass of hot elderberry wine.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;good old times&rdquo; the people&rsquo;s
entertainments differed much from the sports of the present race,
as the following copy of a handbill will show:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">COCKING.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>On Easter Monday, April 23rd, 1810, the holiday folks, in all
their Sunday finery, assembled in great numbers, as was their
custom, at the Bear public house, Lewes road, on the ground
contiguous to which they were entertained with the polished
diversions of cock fighting and the baiting of a badger.&nbsp; On
the following day, Easter Tuesday, according to annual custom, a
bull-bait came <a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>off at Hove; when, during the proceedings, the bull
unexpectedly broke from the stake, and in an instant charged upon
and routed the compact phalanx of gazers, happily without
inflicting material injury on any one.&nbsp; The incident caused
a postponement of the bait till June 11th.&nbsp; The hand-bill
announced:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">A BULL BAIT AT HOVE,<br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">ON</span><br />

<p style="text-align: center">A <span class="smcap">Dinner</span>

</blockquote>
<p>The dinner took place at the Ship Inn, Hove, in the field
belonging to which,&mdash;that whereon the Coast Guard Station is
erected, at the bottom of Hove Street,&mdash;the baiting took
place.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Brighton is admirably adapted for Hunting, a
sport which received considerable impetus from the Prince of
Wales having an excellent pack of harriers kennelled at the
Prince&rsquo;s Dairy, a suburban retreat on the London Road,
which His Royal Highness purchased of Mr. William Stanford, in
October, 1805.&nbsp; In October, 1821, some of the dogs exhibited
symptoms of hydrophobia; the whole pack was in consequence
destroyed by poison, and the carcasses were conveyed away in a
waggon and buried in a pit, purposely dug to receive them, in the
south part of Streeter&rsquo;s garden, just within the gateway,
to the right of the church path, opposite North Street
Brewery.&nbsp; The Duke of Richmond at that period hunted his fox
hounds in the neighbourhood of Brighton.&nbsp; The present packs
are supported by subscription, and consist of the Southdown Fox
Hounds, and the Brighton and the Brookside Harriers.</p>
<p>About forty years since &ldquo;hobby horse&rdquo; exercise was
a very favourite diversion with the gentry.&nbsp; These
&ldquo;hobbies&rdquo; were the original velocipedes, now worked
by a crank action; but they then consisted only of a fore and a
hind wheel, with a slight saddle rail between, upon which the
rider sat, holding on by a handle that guided the front wheel,
and then, by striking out his feet with a walking action, the
machine became propelled, its speed being regulated by the
ability of the horseman.&nbsp; Much practice and great judgment
<a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>were
required to make a proficient rider.&nbsp; Many extraordinary
feats of pedestrianism were performed with these machines; but
the most arduous were the competing with the stage coaches to and
from London.&nbsp; The earliest account we have of stage coaches
at Brighton is in 1798, when the Princess of Wales pair-horse or
post-coach was put on the road to London by way of Steyning and
Horsham, the same route by which the eight-horse fly-waggons had
previously travelled.&nbsp; Pack-horses were the only mode of
performing the journey prior to the fly-waggons, and the lanes
and bye-ways then being very narrow, recesses in the hedge-rows
were made in certain places to permit of the laden animals
standing aside that they might be passed, as their packs, which
extended considerably on each side of the animals, would
otherwise, frequently come in unpleasant contact with the fair
sex, who on pillions occupied similar positions to merchandize
when on horseback.&nbsp; In 1801, two pair-horse coaches ran
between London and Brighton on alternate days, one up, the other
down, and they were driven by Messrs. Crossweller and Hine.&nbsp;
The progress of these coaches was amusing.&nbsp; The one from
London left the Blossoms Inn, Lawrence Lane, at 7 a.m.; the
passengers breaking their fast at the Cock, Sutton, at 9.&nbsp;
The next stoppage for the purpose of refreshment was at the
Tangier&mdash;Banstead Downs,&mdash;a rural little spot, famous
for its elderberry wine, which used to be brought from the
cottage &ldquo;roking hot,&rdquo; and, on a cold wintry morning,
few refused to partake of it.&nbsp; George the Fourth invariably
stopped here and took a glass from the hand of Miss Jeal, as he
sat in his carriage.&nbsp; The important business of luncheon
took place at Reigate, where sufficient time was allowed the
passengers to view the Barons&rsquo; Cave, where it is said the
Barons assembled the night previous to their meeting King John at
Runnymeade.&nbsp; The grand halt, for dinner, was made at
Staplefield Common, celebrated for its famous black cherry trees,
under the branches of which, when the fruit was ripe, the coaches
were allowed to draw up and the passengers to partake of its
tempting produce.&nbsp; The hostess of the hostelry here was
famed for her rabbit puddings, which, hot, were always waiting
the arrival of the coach, and to which the travellers never
failed to do such ample justice that ordinarily they found it
quite impossible to leave at the hour appointed; so grogs, pipes
<a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>and ale
were ordered in, and, to use the language of the fraternity,
&ldquo;not a wheel wagged&rdquo; for two hours.&nbsp; Handcross
was the next resting place, celebrated for its &ldquo;neat&rdquo;
liquors, the landlord of the inn standing bottle-in-hand at the
door.&nbsp; He and several other Bonifaces, at Friar&rsquo;s Oak,
&amp;c., had the reputation of being on pretty good terms with
the smugglers who carried on their operations with such audacity
along the Sussex Coast.&nbsp; After walking up Clayton Hill a cup
of tea was sometimes found to be necessary at Patcham; after
which Brighton was safely reached at 7 p.m.&nbsp; It must be
understood that it was the custom for the passengers to walk up
all the hills, and even sometimes, in heavy weather, give a push
behind to assist the jaded horses.</p>
<p>About 1809, a great revolution took place in coach
travelling.&nbsp; Some gentlemen,&mdash;at the head of whom was
the late Mr. William Bradford, or, as he was then styled,
&ldquo;Miller&rdquo; Bradford,&mdash;12 in number, formed a
capital by shares of &pound;100 each, and established two
four-horse coaches.&nbsp; The cattle were cast-horses of the
Inniskilling Dragoons, then stationed at Brighton.&nbsp; In 1815,
another vehicle of the same class, the &ldquo;Bellerophon,&rdquo;
a huge concern, built with two compartments, one carrying six,
the other four inside, and with several out, was driven by Mr.
Hine.&nbsp; This coach received its name from the ship in which
Bonaparte, after his defeat at Waterloo, was conveyed to exile at
St. Helena.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Bellerophon&rdquo; was soon found to
be too heavy for the improving speed, and was abandoned for
lighter vehicles, until travelling attained its perfection on the
Brighton road, the time taken in the transit having diminished
from twelve hours to five, and on one occasion the
&ldquo;Quicksilver,&rdquo; with a &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
speech&rdquo; of William IV., made the journey down in three
hours and forty minutes!&nbsp; From the year 1822, at different
periods of the year, not less than sixty coaches were on the
road,&mdash;thirty each way.</p>
<p>On a moderate calculation, Hine must have brought into the
town more than one hundred thousand persons, and that without an
accident: a circumstance which, in its day, was as beneficial to
Brighton as is now the proverbially high character for safety,
convenience, and civility of the London and Brighton
Railway.&nbsp; Amongst the celebrities of the day whom Hine was
accustomed to <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>bring down, were Mathews, in his &ldquo;prime and
bang-up,&rdquo; who used invariably to borrow the huge box-coat
of seven capes; Munden; Lieutenant or Jack Bannister; Quick,
another famous actor; &ldquo;Squire&rdquo; Thornton, of Clapham;
Rev. Rowland Hill; and many noblemen of the Court of George
IV.&nbsp; Most of these men are, of course, like Hine himself,
&ldquo;dead and past away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some few passengers,
however, who have travelled by the &ldquo;Union&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; and who have &ldquo;booked&rdquo; in East
Street by Miss Hine,&mdash;the honest old coachman&rsquo;s
daughter and sister of Mr. H. G. Hine, the artist whose works
adorn much of the illustrated literature of the present
day,&mdash;still survive; others must have had the name made
familiar to them by hearing their fathers and grandfathers
talking of the famous coaches and coachmen of Brighton.</p>
<p>In the height of Brighton coaching times, Castle Square upon
the departure and arrival of the coaches,&mdash;but more
especially at noon, when from the &ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; &ldquo;Snow&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Age&rdquo; offices, the &ldquo;crack&rdquo; whips, the
<i>elite</i> of passengers, and the best &ldquo;blood&rdquo; on
the road, started at the striking of the Pavilion
clock,&mdash;was thronged with company to witness a most
animating and animated scene.&nbsp; Of coaching nothing now
remains at Brighton but the parcels&rsquo; booking office of the
Railway Company, originally the &ldquo;Red&rdquo; and
subsequently the &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; coach office.</p>
<p>By a singular inadvertence the word &ldquo;Company&rdquo; was
omitted in the original Act of the Brighton Railway, so that the
Directors of it were of the London and Brighton Railway, and not
Railway Company.&nbsp; The amalgamation of the Eastern and
Western branches, under more recent Acts, has constituted the
whole scheme in connexion with the mainline, the London,
Brighton, and South-Coast Railway Company.</p>
<p>As early as 1825 the construction of a railway between
Brighton and London was contemplated; but it was not till 1835
that the subject was entertained with earnestness.&nbsp; Five
schemes were then propounded, known by the names of the different
engineers who projected them, namely: Stephenson&rsquo;s,
Rennie&rsquo;s, Gibbs&rsquo;s, and Cundy&rsquo;s; and the
South-Eastern.&nbsp; The first scheme was most favourably
received; and in September of that year, at a public meeting of
the inhabitants of Brighton, a resolution was <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>passed
requesting the Borough Members to support its adoption in
Parliament.&nbsp; Upon reconsideration, the inhabitants were
impressed with the idea that they had been too precipitate; as
the Terminus of Stephenson&rsquo;s line, being immediately to the
west of Brighton, would only favour that special district,
instead of being beneficial to the town in general; they
therefore reversed their decision in favour of Bennie&rsquo;s, or
the Direct Line.&nbsp; The public mind being thus fickle, the
other competitors anticipating that there was yet a chance for
them, pressed forward their suit, resulting in a severe contest,
which gave promise of a great expenditure of money, with no line
at all; as, protracted by the accumulation of oppositions, the
Session of Parliament for 1837, was about to terminate without
its sanction to either project.&nbsp; The interposition of
Government determined the business; a military engineer, Captain
Alderton, was deputed to investigate and report upon the merits
of the several lines, and his conclusion was, &ldquo;That the
Direct Line is the best line between London and
Brighton.&rdquo;&nbsp; That line, then, was accordingly adopted,
and on the 8th July, 1837, the Bill for its construction received
the Royal assent, with this clause attached, &ldquo;That the
total capital of &pound;1,800,000 be raised by the subscribers to
the several lines in the following proportions:&mdash;The Direct
line&mdash;Bennie&rsquo;s,&mdash;&pound;550,000;
Stephenson&rsquo;s, &pound;550,000; Cundy&rsquo;s,
&pound;100,000; South-Eastern, &pound;330,000; and Gibbs&rsquo;s,
&pound;70,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; The various contracts for the
formation of the line were soon entered into, and on the 4th of
February, 1839, Mr. Alfred Morris laid the first permanent rail
of the line, at Hassock&rsquo;s Gate, Mr. Samuel Thornton being
the contractor, and Mr. T. H. Statham the resident engineer.</p>
<p>On the 11th of May, 1840, the first six miles of the western
branch, to Shoreham, was opened; on the 25th of March, 1841, the
main-line from London to Hayward&rsquo;s Heath, within fifteen
miles of Brighton, was opened; and on Tuesday, September 21st,
1841, the whole of the line of railway from Brighton to London,
was opened with some little ceremony and great rejoicing, the
first trip&mdash;from Brighton to London&mdash;being performed in
two hours and a quarter; leaving Brighton at 6.45 and arriving at
London Bridge Terminus about 9.&nbsp; From time to time other
additions, <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>as branches from the main trunk, have been added,
affording facilities for travelling to most parts of the kingdom
south of the metropolis.</p>
<p>The handsome building of Italian style, which constitutes the
Brighton Terminus, is the design of Mr. Mocatta; and the original
sheds attached to the Terminus were designed by Mr. Rastrick,
whose remains, under a massive granite monument, are deposited in
the Extra-Mural Cemetery, Lewes Road.&nbsp; The Railway is
considered a passenger and pleasure line, and, during the Summer
season, excursion trains make important items in the traffic
returns, as the line is in the direct route from London to Paris,
<i>via</i> Newhaven and Dieppe, and at the various stations
throughout the line villa residences are the retreats of the
families of the London merchants who diurnally travel to and from
their places of business.</p>
<p>Hobby Horse racing round the Level formed an attraction to the
fashionable company that, daily, on horseback and in good
old-fashioned and aristocratic hammerclothed coach-box and
powder-bewigged coachmen and footmened family carriages, thronged
Morris&rsquo;s Royal Repository: for that great toy-mart and
favourite lounge really had regal patronage, especially from
William and Adelaide, who were frequently extensive
purchasers.&nbsp; His Majesty, upon one occasion, when Duke of
Clarence, was struck, while there, with the entrance of three
ladies in the garb of Quakers; and as the two eldest were looking
over some articles of peculiar attraction, His Royal Highness
addressed himself to the youngest, who was about fourteen, and
said, &ldquo;So, I see that thou art not above the vanities of
this gay world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fair young Friend said nothing;
but the matron, under whose care she was, gave a look more
expressive than words.&nbsp; The Duke felt it; and immediately
purchasing a handsome work-basket, respectfully asked the eldest
lady&rsquo;s permission to present it to her daughter.&nbsp; The
answer was mild, but laconic.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will receive it,
and thank thee, friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; The basket was accordingly
taken, with the same courtesy as given; and thus the matter
ended.</p>
<p>During the prosperity of the Repository, which had a fame for
the bows and arrows which it supplied, archery was much in vogue,
the Archery Club having their rendezvous in the Queen&rsquo;s
Park, which is situate on the south-west acclivity of the Race
Hill, <a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>and is approached by an entrance that abruptly
terminates Park Street, contiguous to the German Spa.&nbsp; This
Park, which is between sixty and seventy acres in extent, was
formed in 1825, by Mr. Thomas Attree, whose Italian villa,
designed by the late Sir Charles Barry, crowns its northern
summit.</p>
<p>Various as have been the attractions offered for the
entertainment of visitors, the meed of their success and duration
has preponderated in favour of those projected in the vicinity of
the sea, which is the main feature of attraction to Brighton,
that commands an uninterrupted marine drive and promenade along
its whole three miles&rsquo; frontage.&nbsp; The promenade was of
small dimensions at its commencement, and originated with the
owners of property between Cannon Place and Preston Street, Mr.
Pocock, coal merchant, at its east extreme, and Mr. Robison, of
Regency House, at the west end,&mdash;the promoters of the
undertaking,&mdash;superintending its construction.&nbsp; Its
position was in about the middle of the present carriage-way,
which from time to time has been widened to accommodate the
increased traffic.&nbsp; The original seats upon the
Esplanade&mdash;for so from its commencement has the walk been
called,&mdash;bore the names of the houses in front of which they
were erected; but the Commissioners of the Town, in the plenitude
of their wisdom, perceiving the improvement which would be
effected by extending the walk, took the control of it into their
own hands; and earth from the excavations made for the erection
of the Places, Squares, and Streets adjacent, being abundant, in
a very short space of time the promenade was continued to the
extreme point of the parish, much to the discomfiture of the
owners of boats and bathing machines, who were accustomed, for
safety, to haul up their property upon the Wharf that stood,
protected by a strongly-built brick wall to the south,
immediately off the bottom of Regency Square, whereon, when it
was known as Belle-Vue Field, stood a large capstan, that was
used by means of a small tunnel under the road&mdash;through
which a hawser passed,&mdash;to haul up vessels upon the Deals,
ship-ways that were fixed there for repairing moderately sized
craft.</p>
<p>Not unfrequent sights at this spot were severed capacious
boats of slight build, which had been captured from smugglers,
who had <a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>had the temerity to try a cargo there; as forty years
since, and even more recently, contraband ventures were of very
common occurrence.&nbsp; The last successful &ldquo;run&rdquo; in
broad daylight took place about 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
July 19th, 1821, at the bottom of Ship Street, while the Custom
House Officers were attracted to the Level to witness the
Coronation sports.&nbsp; The working party had assembled in the
Old Ship Yard, and at a signal given, by way of the Gap 300 kegs
of Hollands were slung and off before the few persons present,
who remained in the town, could comprehend the scene.&nbsp; Most
of the cargo was, as usual, conveyed inland, where the readiest
means were offered for its concealment and disposal.&nbsp;
Captured smugglers were, at that period, put on board the Hound
revenue cutter, Captain Butler commander, which was stationed off
Brighton, and a smuggler chase by her was frequently a very
exciting scene from the shore.&nbsp; Men who embarked in the
hazardous enterprise were frequently missing; but whether their
lives were sacrificed or they had been captured and shipped off
in the Royal Navy, upon foreign service, a considerable lapse of
time and a combination of circumstances only determined.&nbsp;
One of the most desperate of a noted gang in the neighbourhood of
Brighton was David Scales, who, on the night of November 7th,
1796, while going, with many more, over the hill to Patcham,
heavily laden, was overtaken by excise officers and
soldiers.&nbsp; The smugglers fled in all directions; a riding
officer, as such persons were called, gave chase to Scales, who
was likewise on horseback, and called upon him to surrender his
booty, which he refused to do.&nbsp; The officer knew that Scales
was too good a man for him, they having tried it before; so he
shot Daniel through the head.</p>
<p>A monument to his memory was erected in Patcham churchyard,
with the following inscription, now obliterated by
time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the Memory<br
/>
of<br />
DANIEL SCALES,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Who was unfortunately shot, on
Tuesday evening,<br />
Nov. 7, 1796.</p>
<p>Alas! swift flew the fatal lead,<br />
Which pierced through the young man&rsquo;s head<br />
He instant fell, resigned his breath,<br />
And closed his languid eyes in death.</p>
<p><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>All
you who to this stone draw near,<br />
Oh! pray let fall the pitying tear:<br />
From this sad instance may we all<br />
Prepare to meet Jehovah&rsquo;s call. <a
name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313"
class="citation">[313]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 24th of April, 1806, an encounter took place off
Brighton, between the revenue cutter, Leopard, and a smuggler,
when Aldridge, the commander of the contraband vessel, was killed
in the action, and one of his crew, named Morris, was so
desperately wounded in the chest that he died a few days
afterwards.</p>
<p>As a more immediate than a sidelong marine walk, the Chain
Pier was projected, agreeable to the annexed
prospectus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The utility of a Pier at Brighton, carried a
sufficient distance beyond high-water mark, so as to enable Steam
Packets and boats to lay alongside, and embark or land their
passengers, is universally admitted; and the proposition has
excited greater interest since the resolution has been formed of
establishing a Steam Packet Company to France, because it is
reasonably anticipated that the two concerns, although not
intended to be incorporated, must be essentially beneficial to
each other.</p>
<p>In a national point of view it is certainly most desirable,
that the intercourse between the two countries should be
facilitated and extended; and there can be no measure adopted
which could more effectually promote this end and increase the
prosperity of this great and flourishing town, than the proposed
Pier.</p>
<p>When so many advantages are evidently comprehended, both to
the individuals who may be concerned in the undertaking, and the
public generally, it becomes a subject of deeper solicitude, that
there should be no fallacy in the principle, no imperfection in
the constitution, which would endanger its future security, and
frustrate the important object.</p>
<p>First, with regard to the durability of the materials, it
should be observed, that it is intended to construct the Pier,
wholly of iron, with the exception of the platform.&nbsp; The
oxedale of cast Iron is so incorruptible that its effects can
scarcely be brought within the scope of calculation; and wrought
iron, with common attention to cleaning and painting, may be
considered as almost imperishable.&nbsp; But even if the time
should arrive (which must be exceedingly remote) to render it
necessary to renew it, every bar can be taken out and the whole
replaced in detail, without any interruption to the passage of
the Pier, so that the capital invested in the concern is not
chargeable with more than common interest.&nbsp; The planking of
the gangway will require to be renewed perhaps once in ten or
fifteen years, and this expense is accounted for under the head
of charges.</p>
<p>With regard to its strength, when there are so many
conspicuous examples of the powers of piles to resist the sea in
the most exposed situations, any theoretical illustration would
be superfluous.&nbsp; But before notice is taken of the works
which have preceded and given rise to the proposed plan, a few
instances may be <a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>stated, such as the Sheers, the Whittaker, the Gun
Fleet, and other beacons on the North Coast; and coming nearer to
the point itself, the iron beacon on the Black Rock, near Leith,
which is about two miles S.E. from the Trinity Pier, has stood
alone for years; North Yarmouth jetty, and the Pier at Ostend, on
the opposite coast, remain firm, opposed to the sea from the S.E.
and N.W. and require no repair but what arises from the decay of
the timber; and at Cronstadt, in the Gulph of Finland, there are
batteries erected on piles like so many islands, which have
remained there from the time of Peter the Great.</p>
<p>It may now be noticed, without entering into so wide a field,
that the Trinity Pier, which (although on the same principle) is
in all respects a more slender and inferior structure to the
proposed Pier for Brighton, was erected during the stormy season
of the equinox; and even in its unfinished state, while it was of
course less capable of resisting the shock of the sea, it
suffered no injury; and since its completion, the following
reports will show that its strength and security are beyond all
question, and what is of as much importance, its utility has
surpassed the most sanguine expectations.</p>
<p>Copy of a Report from the Directors of the Trinity Pier
Company, dated Leith, Sept. 20, 1821:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are to certify, that the Trinity Pier was loaded
with 118 Pigs of iron ballast, or upwards of 20 Tons, the same
that were sent out by Mr. Crichton for proving the said Pier, and
that the above ballast was loaded between the piers regularly
placed.&nbsp; And we also certify that there was no interruption
to the passengers to and from the Steam Boats that were laying
alongside at the time it was so loaded.&nbsp; And we further
certify, that under all the circumstances of the case, that the
said Pier has undergone a more severe trial or proof than was
specified in the agreement with Captain Brown; and that the said
Pier is in all respects perfect, and in good order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given under our hands at Leith, this 20th day of Sept.
1821.</p>

<p>Copy of the second Report from the Directors of the Trinity
Pier Company, dated Leith, the 16th November, 1821:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Leith, Nov. 16, 1821.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Captain
Samuel Brown</span>, R.N.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;In compliance with your wish to hear how the
new Pier of Suspension, at Trinity, has stood the late violent
easterly gales, to which it is very much exposed, we feel very
great pleasure in informing you that it has not received the most
trifling damage; and that since the pier-head has been lengthened
to 70 feet, the Steam Boats are able to lay on the lee-side of it
with perfect security in the strongest gales we have had, the
violence of the sea being exhausted in passing through the
different ranges of the piles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So little is the vibration of the chains and platform,
that we have never known the least alarm to be expressed by
passengers going along it; and great numbers frequent it even in
this inclement season, merely for the purpose of taking a walk
along it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, Sir,<br />
Your obedient Servants.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Signed) &ldquo;ALEXANDER SCOTT,<br
/>
ALEXANDER STEVENSON,<br />
Directors of Trinity Pier Company.<br />
GEORGE CRICHTON, Treasurer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>As
there will be plans upon an extended scale, laid before a general
meeting, or a committee of management, it is unnecessary to
advert to them at present: it may, however, be satisfactory to
state, the extent, from high-water-mark to the end of the Pier,
1,000 feet, and the width ten feet: each of the inverted arches
will be 251 feet span, and the outer Pier-head will form an area
of about 4,500 feet, and an elevation of 10 feet above the
highest spring-tides.&nbsp; The expense of erecting a Pier and
constructing a floating Break-water, which will be essential, as
a protection from ships or vessels running foul of it, and at the
same time afford additional facility and convenience for ships
putting to sea from the beach, will be &pound;27,000. <a
name="citation315"></a><a href="#footnote315"
class="citation">[315]</a>&nbsp; It is proposed that a Company
should be constituted and incorporated, under the denomination of
the Brighton Pier Company, and that the sum of &pound;27,000,
forming the joint stock of the Company, be raised by
subscriptions of &pound;100 each.&mdash;The affairs of the
Company to be conducted and managed by a Committee, consisting of
a Treasurer and 10 Members, who are to be chosen by a majority of
votes of the Proprietors, at a General Meeting; and that five of
the said Committee are also to be chosen by a majority of votes
to act as Directors or Managers of the Company; and that the
Committee of Management and the Directors collectively, shall
have the power of appointing a Pier Master, and other persons,
whose services or avocations may be required for the general
benefit and advantage of the Company.&nbsp; All other rules
relative to the reciprocity of interest and the financial
branches of the Company, are to be fully set forth and explained
in a separate instrument, to be drawn up in a proper legal form
by a Solicitor.</p>
<p>The situation in all respects most suitable both for the
convenience of the public and the interest of the Brighton Pier
Company, is opposite the East Parade of the Old Steyne, and as T.
R. Kemp, Esq., and C. S. Dickens, Esq., have, in the most liberal
and handsome manner, which must lay, not only the proprietors of
the Pier, but the whole community, under lasting obligations,
granted a sufficient space of ground for forming the Pier, and
relinquished all their manorial rights, it will not be necessary
to apply for an Act of Parliament for authority to levy and
collect a toll, or pontage in the Pier, because the beach is free
for landing and embarking in boats as heretofore, and it becomes
perfectly voluntary or optional to enter upon and pay for the
accommodation of the Pier.</p>
<p>It is intended that the platform shall be horizontal with the
East Parade, and extend in the same direction out to sea&mdash;as
there can be no doubt that the Pier would become a place of
fashionable resort, great emoluments would be derived from this
source alone,&mdash;independent of this, would be the specific
revenue secured by a lease to be paid by the Proprietors of the
Steam-Packets, and as it is one of the objects of the Pier to
permit the shipment of carriages and horses, under certain
regulations consistent with the convenience of visitors, a
considerable sum will be raised by this means.</p>
<p>It is not intended that Merchant&rsquo;s ships should load or
discharge their cargoes at the Pier, and no fish to be landed
unless under particular circumstances to be judged by the
Pier-Master;&mdash;but as great advantages must be derived to the
Town, and Proprietors of the Pier, from the traffic in fruit,
eggs, &amp;c. &amp;c. with France, small-craft and boats are to
be permitted to come alongside, by <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>paying certain dues for the vessels,
and a certain rate upon their goods, the amount of which will be
fixed by the Committee of Management; pleasure-boats, and boats
hired for pleasure, are to pay certain dues for laying alongside
the Pier, and a further rate for the company landing from or
embarking on board them, and the shore boats belonging to the
Town of Brighton and others, which are in the constant practice
of using the beach, whether owned in the town or not, are to be
permitted to land passengers, who are to pay the usual rate for
landing on the Pier; but the boats before-mentioned are to be
exempted from paying any dues for <i>coming</i> alongside, and
the crew are to be allowed to land without any charge being made:
but such boats are not to continue at the Pier longer than is
necessary to land or take on board passengers or pleasure
parties, and are to be subject to the orders of the Pier-Master,
in regard to the length of time to be allowed for this purpose,
and this permission alluded to is not to be considered as an
abandonment of the right of the Pier Company to charge boats of
the above description the usual Pier dues, but as a favor and
preference given to the fishermen and boatmen belonging to the
Town of Brighton and its dependencies.</p>
<p>There is no circumstance connected with this establishment of
a Pier at Brighton, which will be viewed with more satisfaction,
either by the Proprietors or the Public, than the ready means it
will afford of dispatching boats to the assistance of vessels in
distress&mdash;however well disposed the fishermen or pilots may
be to venture to sea in a heavy gale to their relief, their
utmost skill and hardihood are unavailable to launch their boats
through the serf at low water; and even at the height of the tide
it is frequently impracticable; it is therefore intended either
to construct a slip or inclined plane in the centre of the
outward Pier, to contain a boat of the largest class, and provide
anchors and cables for her, and appoint her in all respects ready
to launch off in the heaviest gale at a moment&rsquo;s
notice,&mdash;or to erect Davits on each side of the Pier to
support boats, which will always be ready to lower
down.&mdash;There are no description of vessels better calculated
for this service than what are termed the Brighton
hog-boats,&mdash;when they are fairly clear of the beach and
breakers, (which the boat would be the moment it was launched,)
they work off the coast in the most surprising manner.</p>
<p>As it will at all events be necessary to have a boat&rsquo;s
crew of at least four active able bodied men, belonging to the
Pier, those men, in order to be available for the duty alluded
to, must be Pilots for Shoreham or Newhaven, and when the large
boat is to be sent to sea there can be no difficulty in engaging
three or four men to complete the compliment.&nbsp; That in the
course of time many ships and vessels may receive assistance, and
be saved from shipwreck by this means, is the most reasonable of
all hypotheses&mdash;and as the vessel and other smaller boats
would be part of the property of the Company, and maintained by
it, they would be entitled to salvage or to a remuneration in
proportion to the extent of services rendered, as usual in such
cases.</p>
<p>But the sources from whence the revenue of the Pier is to be
derived, which will yield a large interest to the Proprietors
agreeable to the sum which they may have respectively invested,
will be so satisfactorily shewn in the following statement, that
it is not necessary to reckon on any profits arising from such
contingencies, however plausible and flattering the prospect may
be.</p>

<p>It is much doubted whether the expectations of either the
projectors or the shareholders have ever been realized, except as
regards outlay and charges.&nbsp; The structure was commenced in
October, 1822, and completed in twelve months.&nbsp; On the 25th
of November, it was opened by the skilful projector, Sir Samuel
Brown, <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>R.N.&nbsp; The Pier, which projects 1,150 feet, is
approached by an Esplanade 1,250 feet in length.&nbsp; The
foundation consists of four clumps of iron shod and nail-mailed
piles strongly bound by cross and wale pieces of great
substance.&nbsp; The clumps are 250 feet apart, and are crowned
with cast-iron towers, over which pass the main suspension chains
that emerge from the cliff, into which they are canned fifty-four
feet, and are there fastened to a mass of iron, three tons in
weight, firmly embedded in masonry.&nbsp; The south ends of the
chains pass down a casing of wood to the rock, into which and the
massive piles of the extreme platform they are bolted and
keyed.</p>
<p>Just one year after the completion of the Pier, namely, on the
23rd November, 1824, the structure underwent a severe trial, but
it nobly stood a storm which devastated the southern coast of
England, some portion of the wooden platform and the ornamental
iron-work alone receiving slight damage.&nbsp; Two dolphins,
however, to the west of the Pier in an angular position,
consisting of small clusters of piles, over the crown of which to
the Pier-head large chains were stretched to fend-off any vessels
that might be driven in by a south-west gale, were completely
washed away.&nbsp; The havock to property along the sea-front of
the town was tremendous.</p>
<p>On the 15th of October, 1833, the structure received some
injury from lightning, and on the 22nd of November following a
dreadful gale of wind, after causing the platform to writhe like
the action of a serpent, heaved-up the chains, twisting the
pendant rods into fantastical shapes, discharging the wooden
roadway into the raging surf, and wrenching one of the towers
from its perpendicular.&nbsp; The inhabitants, looking upon the
injury done as a calamity to the town, immediately set a
subscription on foot, and in a very short time, &pound;1,200 was
raised to effect the restoration of the edifice, which was
further secured by a chain cable beneath the platforms, attached
to each clump of piles, to check all future oscillation and
heaving.</p>
<p>For many years the arrival and departure of steam packets,
employed in the passenger intercourse between Brighton and
Dieppe, formed a great attraction for visitors to the Pier.&nbsp;
The first steamer employed in the station was the Swift, of
eighty-horse power.&nbsp; A packet service by sailing vessels,
previously existed, during <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>the times of peace, dating as far
back as 1792, when the Prince of Wales, a schooner, Captain
Burton; the Princess Royal, a schooner, Captain Chapman; and the
Speedwell, a cutter, Captain Lind, were the vessels
employed.&nbsp; These were succeeded by the Nancy, Captain
Blaber, which was run down in mid-channel; Ann and Elizabeth,
Captain Daniels; Nautilus, Captain Wingfield, who is still alive
and vends pork in Brighton Market; Elizabeth, Captain Lind; Lord
Wellington, Captain Cheesman, who was afterwards, for years, in
the General Steam Navigation Company&rsquo;s service, on the same
route; Prince Regent, Captain Bulbeck; Neptune, Captain Wallis;
and the Thomas, Captain Clear.&nbsp; This vessel was instrumental
in saving the life of Mr. Charles Green, the celebrated aeronaut,
on the occasion of his ascent from the Gas Works, at Black Rock,
October 1st, 1821, with his Coronation balloon.&nbsp; The Thomas
had left some of her passengers and the Captain at Eastbourne,
and was just off Beachy Head, in charge of the Mate, Francis
Cheesman, who bore down upon the balloon, then unmanageable upon
the water, and driving the vessel&rsquo;s bowsprit into the silk
of the aerial machine soon liberated the gas, and rescued Mr.
Green from his frail wicker-work car.</p>
<p>At various periods the Chain Pier has been the medium and
focus of special entertainments in the separate and combined
attractions of fire and water.&nbsp; The structure on the evening
of its inauguration was illuminated on both sides throughout its
whole extent, in coloured lamps forming &ldquo;God Save the
Queen, and the House of Brunswick.&rdquo;&nbsp; More recently
exhibitions of fireworks have taken place upon it.&nbsp; The most
memorable event by way of pastime was the Brighton and Hove
Regatta, which took place on Thursday and Saturday, July 21st and
23rd, 1853, when public money to the extent of &pound;364, was
competed for, prizes of &pound;120, &pound;105, and &pound;52
10s, by yachts, and other prizes varying from &pound;20
downwards, to the number of fourteen by sailing and rowing
boats.&nbsp; The weather for several days previous to the
Regatta&mdash;which had been arranged to extend through three
days,&mdash;was most unfavourable, a strong wind from the
south-west preventing the arrival of yachts which had just
contended in the Yarmouth Regatta.&nbsp; Several however, of
heavy tonnage were in the matches, the first of which <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>was gained
by the Alarm, 248 tons, J. Welds, Esq., in a contest with the
Sveridge, 280 tons, T. Bartlett, Esq., which was declared by
yachting men unparalleled in the superior nautical tactics which
were displayed.&nbsp; The Hotel-Keepers&rsquo; Prize of 50
guineas, with 50 guineas added, was won by the Arrow, 102 tons,
T. Chamberlayne, Esq., four competed.&nbsp; The
Ship-Owners&rsquo; Prize of 50 guineas was gained by the Phantom,
25 tons, S. Lane, Esq., beating the Thought, 25 tons, G. Coope,
Esq.&nbsp; The First Class Pleasure Boat match, &pound;20, was
won by the Skylark, Mr. A. T. Mills; and in the Second Class
Pleasure Boat contest for 10 guineas, the Royal Frederick, Mr. B.
Kent, successfully contended against three others.&nbsp; In the
four-oared Galley contest for &pound;15, the Arrow, Mr. J.
Nottidge succeeded against six others.&nbsp; Friday, the
intervening day of the matches, was an entire blank; a dense fog
with a drizzling rain prevailing from sun-rise to sun-set.&nbsp;
On the evening of Saturday, there was a grand display of
fireworks on the Chain Pier.</p>
<p>The Regatta was of simple origin.&nbsp; A few of the principal
tradesmen who were accustomed to meet of an evening in
conviviality at the New Ship Hotel, chanced in the early part of
March, 1853, to have in their company Captain Moore, connected
with several yachting clubs.&nbsp; He spoke of the admirable
position of Brighton for yachting matches, and the attraction
they would be to the inhabitants and visitors.&nbsp; A
communication was forthwith made to the Commodores of the various
Royal Yacht Clubs, and the idea being favourably entertained by
them, a committee was formed, with Mr. H. P. Tamplin, the High
Constable, as their Chairman, and the author of this book as
their Honorary Secretary.&nbsp; Subscriptions came in
bountifully, the whole of the town being most favourable to the
project.&nbsp; The Railway Directors presented 50 guineas; the
Hotel Keepers gave a prize of 37 guineas; the inhabitants of
Cliftonville 50 guineas; the Ship-Owners 50 guineas; and Chain
Pier Company 18 guineas.&nbsp; The Theatre was placed at the
service of the Committee, and the proceeds of an amateur
performance under the management of Mr. D. H. Greenin, aided the
funds, as did also a fete at the Swiss Gardens, Shoreham, and a
concert at the Royal Pavilion.&nbsp; So anxious and energetic, in
fact, was the public in general for the Regatta to be a great
success, that at its termination, <a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>the sum of &pound;148 remained in
the hands of the Treasurer, arising principally from the weather
preventing the whole of the programme being gone through.</p>
<p>As an Englishman&rsquo;s conclusion to a popular enterprise, a
dinner took place at the Old Ship Hotel; and then, at the New
Ship, where the Committee held their meetings, the
Committee&mdash;of which Mr. Charles Sprake, the landlord, was a
member,&mdash;gave an invitation dinner to the Honorary
Secretary, who was presented, at the hands of the High Constable,
with a most gratifying testimonial, thus
inscribed,&mdash;surmounted with the Brighton Arms,&mdash;upon a
silver-mounted portemonnie:&mdash;&ldquo;Brighton and Hove
Regatta, 1853.&nbsp; Presented to Mr. J. A. Erredge, with a
Complimentary Sum, by the Committee, for his Valuable Services,
as their Honorary Secretary.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a feature of and to
commemorate the Regatta, Mr. John Smith, King&rsquo;s Road, who
fitted-out several of the Committee in nautical attire, had an
appropriate gilt button struck, of neat design.</p>
<p>Amongst the matches not contended for in the Regatta, was that
for the Cliftonville Prize, which remained in abeyance till the
Autumn of 1856, when fresh subscriptions and the interest of the
money in hand, accumulating the Fund to &pound;304, a second
Regatta was arranged, which came off on the 26th of August, when
Prizes to the amount of &pound;207 were awarded.&nbsp; A grand
display of fireworks and the discharge of incidental expenses
cleared off the balance.</p>
<p>A great attraction to the Chain Pier, after the packets ceased
running to and from Dieppe, was a band of music that entertained
the company who promenaded the Pier-head.&nbsp; The Military
Concerts at the Pavilion, however, are at present the musical
feature for visitors, who every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon
throng the suite of Assembly Rooms; and, when the season and
weather are favourable, the eastern lawn, where also, for nine
years past the Brighton and Sussex Horticultural and
Floricultural Society have held their Summer and Autumn Shows,
which annually increase in attraction and importance.&nbsp; The
Museum and Picture Galleries that occupy upper portions of the
Pavilion, likewise afford visitors many an hour&rsquo;s agreeable
ramble amongst the works of art and other rarities which are
daily accumulating.&nbsp; An annual exhibition in connexion with
the Brighton and Sussex School of Art, with an <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>Art Union
attached, takes place in the Galleries; and there is also an
apartment appropriated to the School of Art.&nbsp; In the height
of the season, grand concerts by <i>artistes</i> of celebrity
take place in the Music Room, which, being easier of approach
than the Town Hall, has superseded the large room there, where on
the occasion of Jenny Lind&mdash;the Swedish
Nightingale,&mdash;singing on the 23rd of August, 1847, the
receipts were &pound;1,200.</p>
<p>A species of diversion, termed a soir&eacute;e, has of recent
years been very popular, the intellectual being by it agreeably
blended with the recreative; science and the fine arts gracefully
admitting a sistership with Terpsichore, the active votaries of
which goddess in their sundry modern gyrations of polka and
schottische, contrasting strangely with &ldquo;Lady
Montgomery&rsquo;s Reel,&rdquo; led off in the same Pavilion,
August 13th, 1805, by the Honourable Miss Seymour and a son of
the Duke of Clarence, &ldquo;with suitable ease, spirit, and
vivacity,&rdquo; and in a country-dance to the tune &ldquo;Murphy
Delaney,&rdquo; the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Clarence
&ldquo;taking an active part in the wholesome
exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was as great a diversity then in
dance music as at the present time, passing events suggesting new
ideas to composers and musicians.&nbsp; Upon one occasion, Mr.
Kramer, the leader of the Prince&rsquo;s private band, being in
the Telemachus Room of the Old Ship Hotel, arranging the music
for a ball which was to take place in the evening at the Royal
Pavilion, had his attention attracted by the voice of a noted
character from Lewes, Jemmy Gosney, who with a peculiar nasal
twang was announcing in Ship Street that he had for sale
&ldquo;Book almanack, new almanack, Moore&rsquo;s
Almanack.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the surprise of the vendor of <i>Vox
Stellarum</i>, he heard his words repeated at a window opposite,
where, on his clarionet, Kramer so imitated the old man&rsquo;s
voice, that, in the evening, he availed himself of the incident
to introduce it as a novelty, in the course of a dance, much to
the delight of His Royal Highness and the company in general.</p>
<p>During the sojourn of William and Adelaide in Brighton, in
1834, Sir Andrew Barnard, at the request of his Majesty, enquired
of Mr. Gutteridge, the organist of the Royal Chapel, if there was
anything to be obtained in the way of singing amongst the
townsfolk.&nbsp; <a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>Mr. Gutteridge recommended the members of the Brighton
Madrigal Society, with whom, for eight guineas the evening, an
engagement was effected, but at so short a notice that the
singers were perplexed to procure the appropriate dress for the
occasion, namely, black coats and white vests.&nbsp; At the
suggestion of a friend, however, a second-hand clothes&rsquo;
shop in the Lanes was visited, and there they found all that was
required; but one of the party, who was desirous of the loan of a
coat for the night,&mdash;for which loan a half-crown was
asked,&mdash;not having the cash about him for the deposit that
was required to ensure its safe return, was necessitated to go
out and obtain a well-known hair-dresser in Ship Street as his
bond.&nbsp; The performance of the Madrigals took place in the
Royal Music Room, in the presence of their Majesties and party,
amongst whom was Lady Kennedy Erskine, the King&rsquo;s daughter,
an excellent judge of music, who highly complimented them on the
efficient manner in which they had acquitted themselves.&nbsp;
After the singing, they withdrew and partook of supper, at which
they were attended by two footmen in the Royal livery, to one of
whom the leader of the party&mdash;who had a black ribbon pinned
in his waistcoat pocket to simulate that he wore a watch, and who
was unaccustomed to a servant in waiting,&mdash;said,
&ldquo;Hulloa, old fellow, don&rsquo;t bother yourself about us,
sit down and have some with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The servant smiled,
but declined, and only forgot his position as attendant by
taking, when urgently pressed, a glass of wine all round with the
guests.</p>
<p>In 1834, when Madame Sala, the mother of Mr. F. A. Sala, the
novelist, was in the zenith of her profession as a songstress,
and also as a teacher of singing, a placard on a board was placed
at Eber&rsquo;s Library, now Dutton and Thorowgood&rsquo;s shoe
warehouse, Castle Square, announcing a concert at the Town Hall,
for her benefit; when some person,&mdash;it was supposed envious
of her fame,&mdash;two evenings previous to that announced for
her concert, disfigured the placard by cutting out some of the
letters of her name, making it to read thus:&mdash;MAD SAL,
which, coming to her knowledge, caused Madame to abandon the
concert from fear of further insult.&nbsp; Her patrons
recompensed her, but could not erase from her recollection the
unmerited malignity.</p>
<p><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>Only
a few years since, Brighton was greatly infested with street
music from organs, hurdy-gurdies, and pianettes; a crusade,
however, of the peace authorities drove them from the town, to
which they have not since been allowed to return.&nbsp; Itinerant
bands of wind instrument players yet remain, greatly to the
annoyance of the inhabitants, of whom the performers most
importunately ask remuneration for the woful discord they
discourse.&nbsp; An accredited Town Band of no mean talent is in
existence, supported by voluntary contributions and
subscriptions; but it struggled for some years before it could
attain a position, intruders upon their presumed rights
frequently drafting off, by offers of superior engagements, their
best performers.&nbsp; German bands were at one time very
prevalent, but they remained only the novelty of a few seasons;
pilferings by their leaders, petty quarrels and jealousies
amongst themselves, and the non-appreciation by the public of
what by some persons might be termed their talent, causing most
of them to leave the town, if not the kingdom.&nbsp; The most
respectable of them formed the nucleus of the Town Band, whose
most general place of performance is on the lower western
Esplanade, contiguous to the principal pleasure-boat station,
where parties for a sail or row, or fishing excursion meet with
everything they desire for a nautical pastime.</p>
<p>Persons who are desirous of witnessing deep-sea fishing can
also be gratified by making arrangements with owners of the
regular fishing boats; and as the various kinds of fish, the
habits, manners, customs, and costumes of the fishers, and the
mode of fishing off this coast have not undergone any change by
time, the graphic description of the Brighton Fishery by the
Welsh Zoologist, Thomas Pennant, who died in 1798, is here most
apposite:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fish-market, both wholesale and retail,
is kept on the beach, a little beyond the baths; the boats used
in the fisheries are from ten to fifteen tons, made remarkably
strong to secure them against the storms in their winter
adventure.&nbsp; The mackarel boats are navigated by three or
four men and a boy; there are about forty-five for the mackarel
fishery, and twenty-five for the trawling; they set sail
generally in the evening, go eight or ten leagues to sea, and
return the next day.&nbsp; The fishing is always carried on in
the <a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>night.&nbsp; The crew are provided with tea, coffee,
water, and a small quantity of spirits, for at sea they are
remarkably temperate; their indulgence is only on shore.&nbsp;
They only take with them bread, beef, and greens, which, and
sometimes fish, they often eat with their tea and coffee.&nbsp;
They are a hardy race, and very healthy; yet, during the Summer
season, they have very small interval from labour.&nbsp; They get
a good meal, and a very short repose by lying themselves on a bed
during the few hours in the day on which they come on
shore.&nbsp; They bring their fish in baskets to the beach, fling
them in vast heaps, and instantly a ring of people is formed
round, an auction <a name="citation325a"></a><a
href="#footnote325a" class="citation">[325a]</a> is begun, and
the heap immediately disposed of; the price is uncertain,
according to the success of the night.&nbsp; Mackarel in the year
1793, were sold from &pound;1 to &pound;7 a hundred; they have
been sold as high as &pound;15 a hundred. <a
name="citation325b"></a><a href="#footnote325b"
class="citation">[325b]</a>&nbsp; Mackarel and soles are the
great staples of the place, nine or ten thousand have been taken
at one shooting of the net.&nbsp; Mackarel swim deep in calms,
and rise to the surface in gales, when the largest fish and the
greatest quantity are taken. <a name="citation325c"></a><a
href="#footnote325c" class="citation">[325c]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The nets consist of a number of parts, each of which is
from thirty-six to fifty yards long and deep, and are kept
buoyant by corks.&nbsp; These united form a chain of nets a mile
and a half long.&nbsp; Before they are used in the Spring, they
are taken from the storehouses and spread upon the Steine; a
privilege, time immemorial, granted to the fishermen.&nbsp; The
boats are drawn on shore at the latter end of the Winter, and
placed in ranges on the lower part of the <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>Steyne, and
other places near to the sea.&nbsp; The interval from labour is
very small, for numbers of the boats are in the early Spring
hired out to dredge for oysters, to supply the beds in the Medway
and other places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greater part of the fish is sent to London, packed
in baskets, usually weighing about three quarters of a hundred in
each; they are put into small light carts, which go post, carry
from fifteen to thirty baskets each, and reach our capital in
eight or ten hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mackarel are supposed to come from the Bay of
Biscay.&nbsp; In the early Spring they are taken off Dieppe; they
next appear off Mount&rsquo;s Bay, where they are caught in
seines, and sent by land to London in small baskets; the shooting
of nets has not been found to answer off the Cornish shore.&nbsp;
They arrive in the channel off Brighthelmston in the middle of
April, and continue to the middle of July, after which they will
not mesh, but are caught with hooks, and are at that season
nearly unfit for eating.&nbsp; In June they are observed to
approach nearer the shore; they continue in the channel till the
cold season commences, when they go progressively north or
east.&nbsp; The fry is seen of very small size in October and
November.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The herring fishery begins in October; those fish
appear in great quantities along shore, and reach Hastings in
November.&nbsp; The fishery is very considerable, and adventurers
from every country engage in it.&nbsp; A boat has ten last of ten
thousand each.&nbsp; The fish which are not sent to London fresh,
are salted or cured as red herrings.&nbsp; The nets resemble
those used in the mackarel fishery, only the meshes are smaller:
they are about twenty feet deep, and are left to sink of
themselves.&nbsp; The congenerous pilchards are sometimes taken
here in the mackarel nets, but in very small quantities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soles, the other staple fish, are taken in trawls in
great numbers.&nbsp; The fishery begins in April, and continues
all the Summer: in April, 1794, the weight of two tons was caught
in one night.&nbsp; I saw in the same month a heap of soles on
the market beach none of which were less than nineteen inches
long.&nbsp; The other congenerous fishes were turbots, generally
very indifferent; brills or pearl; smear dabs; plaice, and
flounders.</p>
<p><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>&ldquo;Various kinds of rays are taken here; such as
the skate, the fuller, the thornback, the sand-ray, which has
sharp slender spines on the edges, opposite to the eyes; minute
spines along the edges of the fins, and upon the fins like the
fuller; the back and tail shagreened, marked with round black
spots; the teeth sharp and slender.&nbsp; A ray, not uncommon on
the Flintshire coasts, is twenty-one inches long, of which the
tail is eleven; the nose is pointed, and semi-transparent; two
spines above each eye, and three placed in a row on the back;
three rows on the tail, of which the middle runs far up the back
edges of the body from the nose to the anal fin, rough, with rows
of minute spines; back quite smooth, of a fine pale brown,
regularly marked with circular black spots; teeth quite flat and
smooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the shark genus, the angel-fish is not
uncommon.&nbsp; The smooth sharks, or topes, are very numerous;
they grow to the length of four feet.&nbsp; I saw opened several
of this species, and can vouch for the truth of the young
entering the mouth of the parent in time of danger, and taking
refuge in the stomach.&nbsp; I have seen from twelve to twenty
taken out of a single tope, each eleven or twelve inches
long.&nbsp; This species is split, salted, and eaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I here met with the corbeagle of Mr. Jago.&nbsp; The
length was three feet nine inches, the thickest circumference two
feet one inch.&nbsp; It is a rare species, allied to the
Beaumaris shark.&nbsp; The greater and lesser spotted dog-fish
are very numerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The common angler is frequently caught here, and
sometimes of an enormous size; from the vast width of the mouth
it is called here the kettle-man.&nbsp; The launce, and two
species or weevers, are very common; the greater grows to the
length of sixteen inches, is two inches deep, the weight of two
pounds, and is a firm well-tasted fish.&nbsp; The fishermen have
a great dread of the spines, and cut them off as soon as
taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cod fish tribe are rather scarce, except the
whitings, which are sometimes caught in mackarel nets, but
chiefly with hooks.&nbsp; They are taken in April; but the best
season is in October.&nbsp; I saw here the common cod, the
whiting-pout, the coal-fish, and the five-bearded cod.</p>
<p><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>&ldquo;The doree is frequently taken here: I saw one of
fifteen pounds weight, and the length of three quarters of a
yard.&nbsp; I saw here the lunated gilthead, and ancient wrasse,
the basse, and red or striped surmullet: the last small.&nbsp;
The red and the grey gurnards were common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salmons are unknown here, which I am told is the case
on all chalky coasts.&nbsp; The gar or needle-fish are often seen
here, and of great lengths.&nbsp; I shall digress improperly in
saying that the razor bills and guillemots, inhabitants of Beachy
Head, are frequently caught in the mackarel nets, unwarily diving
in the pursuit of the fish.&nbsp; Prawns are in their season
taken in vast abundance near the shores, which wanting rocks to
give shelter to the lobsters and crabs, those delicacies are
brought from the more distant parts of the coast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very general pastime with the low caste of the seafarers,
when the weather is too boisterous for their fishing and boating
operations, is sea-roaming, watching the margin of the turbulent
waves upon the beach, to pick up the trifles which the surge may
chance to throw up.&nbsp; Some years since,&mdash;before steam
vessels were in use,&mdash;when weather-bound ships were unable
to get out of the bay, of which Brighton forms the northern
boundary, wrecks of richly laden crafts frequently afforded rare
prizes for the roamers, who now, more than from the spoils,
<i>via jetsam et flotsam</i>, pick up from strangers whom they
may chance to meet on their stroll, many a silver coin,
fictitious tales of their losses, bad voyages, and their starving
large families, rarely failing to exact a coin of the realm,
hence they are known amongst the better class of the nautical
fraternity by the name of cadgers.&nbsp; On the faith, too, that
&ldquo;early birds pick up the worms,&rdquo; not to be despised a
living is obtained by frequenting at day-break the vicinity of
houses where parties have been held the previous night, in search
of jewellery, trinkets, or money that by any casualty may have
been dropped.&nbsp; For many years this mode of life has been a
monopoly by a man named Simmonds, who, also, throughout the
livelong day pursues with a keen eye and a raking stick the
business of gutter hunter.</p>

THE HISTORICAL STREET OF THE TOWN.</h2>
<p>For historical lore, few continuous ranges of buildings in the
kingdom are connected with so many national and local incidents
as West Street, Brighton, which was formerly approached from the
west, at the south end, by a hill, that ranged with Kent Street,
which originally terminated due south to the West Cliff.&nbsp;
The hill was of an altitude that, upon its removal, to make the
roadway level between Russell Street and West Street, the front
doors of the houses were one story above the pathway, compelling
the construction of flights of steps in the fore-courts,
commencing from east to west half the distance up, where a
landing was formed, from whence another flight set off northward
to the door-ways.&nbsp; The Cliff there at that time, was known
as The Bank, a provincial term still used for it by most of the
aborigines.&nbsp; The incline of the Gap went from the east
corner of the street, direct south to the sea, which washed it in
stormy weather, when, for safety, the bathing-machines and the
boats stationed thereabouts, were hauled into the street as high
up as Duke Street.</p>
<p>Upon the first house in the street, that at the south corner
of Kent Street, for many years, just beneath the parapet which
surmounted the front wall, was a Latin inscription in raised
Roman capitals, which at various periods, as some of the letters
became obliterated by their great exposure to the weather, and
from their restoration not being effected with promptitude,
underwent several changes, as, <span class="smcap">Excitat acta
robur</span>, strength awakens action, i.e., the consciousness of
power arouses men to acts; <span class="smcap">Excitas actis
robur</span>, thou awakest strength by deeds; <span
class="smcap">Excitat actis robur</span>, he arouses to strength
by acts; <span class="smcap">Excitas acta, robur</span>, thou
wakest or excitest to deeds or actions, O strength.&nbsp; Its
last appearance, <span class="smcap">Excitus acta
ropat</span>,&mdash;which defied all efforts of
translation,&mdash;being the cause of much ridicule, the letters
were entirely removed.&nbsp; Immediately opposite this house,
suspended from the Cliff, was the town fire-cage, constructed of
iron hoops, wherein, at night, a fire of
strombolum&mdash;collected along the sea shore,&mdash;and common
coal, was generally kindled, as a guide to the fishermen on their
return to shore.&nbsp; <a name="page330"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>On New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1810, a
horrid act of brutal violence was committed in connexion with
this land-mark: Two men, named Rolfe and Barton, who were engaged
to attend to the fire, having some words in the course of the
evening, Rolfe determined to arrange the beacon by himself, and
therefore procured a new iron frame and suspended it
accordingly.&nbsp; This, however, he had no sooner done than
Barton attempted to cut the fastenings and let it over the Cliff,
and as Rolfe endeavoured to prevent his carrying his ill-natured
design into effect, Barton thrust a knife into his abdomen, and
literally let out some of his bowels.&nbsp; Barton escaped, but a
reward of &pound;20 being offered through the Town Crier, he was
captured, but only suffered a short imprisonment, as Rolfe, after
having endured great pain, eventually recovered.</p>
<p>The events connected with the King&rsquo;s Head have been
detailed in Chapter XVIII.&nbsp; The low, stone-coloured, brick
building immediately opposite this hostelry, was the favourite
residence of Mrs. Thrale, the wife of the wealthy owner of the
London Brewery, now known as &ldquo;Barclay and Perkins&rsquo;s
Brewery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amongst the general visitors to Mrs. Thrale
were Dr. Samuel Johnson and Madame D&rsquo;Arblay&mdash;Fanny
Burney&mdash;the authoress of Evelena, who in one of her
letters&mdash;Madame d&rsquo;Arblay&rsquo;s Diary&mdash;describes
the residence as being at the court end of the town, and exactly
opposite the inn where Charles II. lay hid previous to leaving
the kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I fail not,&rdquo; she adds,
&ldquo;to look at it with loyal satisfaction, and His
black-wigged Majesty has from the time of its restoration been
its sign.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Thrale, who upon her second marriage
was Madame Piozzi, the mother of Mrs. Mostyn, who died recently
at Sillwood House, has her name thus recorded in the parish
book&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>February 16th, 1791.&mdash;On application of Mrs
Thrale, it is ordered that a poor boy proposed by her be received
into the Poor House, during the pleasure of the officers, on
being paid by the said Mrs Thrale 4s weekly for his board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It happened upon one occasion that while Dr. Johnson was
visiting the Thrales, he accompanied them to the
Baths,&mdash;those on the site where Brill&rsquo;s Ladies&rsquo;
Swimming Bath now stands,&mdash;at which public lounge he met the
Vicar, the Rev. Henry Michell, with whom, drawing their chairs
close to the fire in the ante-room, he <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>soon got
into conversation.&nbsp; For some time their manner was calm and
their language subdued; but at length some strong difference
arising in their arguments, the Vicar seized the poker, and the
Doctor the tongs, with which, upon the grate they suited
&ldquo;their action to the word&rdquo; with the utmost
energy.&nbsp; The general company present, who were enjoying a
country dance, suddenly ceased their evolutions, which could not
be resumed till the Master of the Ceremonies, Wade, with his
proverbial politeness, pacified the heated debaters.</p>
<p>The water from a wooden pump at Thrale&rsquo;s house, was
supposed to be endowed with peculiar medicinal properties, from
the circumstance that after his too potent night indulgences in
wine, Dr. Johnson was accustomed early the following
morning&mdash;before the family were about,&mdash;to slip down
stairs in his dressing gown, and doffing his wig, require of the
female domestic to pump freely on his over-heated bald
head.&nbsp; Mr. Hargraves, apothecary, who afterwards occupied
the premises, being aware of the Doctor&rsquo;s infallible
restorative after his potations, strongly, in the way of
business, prescribed the marvellous liquid to customers who had
been too devout at the shrine of Bacchus.</p>
<p>Foote, the comedian, one day, dining at the house, with
Johnson and others, finding nothing to his liking, for some time
sat in expectation of something better.&nbsp; A neck of mutton
being the last thing, he refused it, as he had the others.&nbsp;
As the servant was taking it away, however, understanding that
there was nothing more, Foote called out to him,
&ldquo;Holloa!&nbsp; John, bring that back again, for I find
it&rsquo;s neck or nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior to 1794, a low public house, called the Half-Moon, stood
out prominently and fronted down the street immediately below
Bunker&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; It was the general resort of gipsies
and beggars, who so continued to throng the house during the
Summer months, that on their taking their leave at the
termination of the previous Autumn, the owner, Mr. Patching,
demolished the old premises and constructed the present building,
known as the Brighton Sauce Warehouse, to afford the wandering
customers better accommodation upon their return.&nbsp; The
Winter of 1793&ndash;4 was very severe; to facilitate, then, the
progress of the building during the frost, the boulders of which
the front is principally composed, were heated at <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>the
malt-kiln of the West Street Brewery, the men employed in the
work being principally the soldiers of the militia regiments
quartered in the West Street Barracks.&nbsp; The new building
proved to be a great mistake; as the migratory tribes, on their
return in the Summer, thinking that extra charges would be made
upon them to assist in defraying the expenses of the new
erection, betook themselves to other quarters, and hence, from
lack of custom, the license was transferred to a smaller house,
the present Half-Moon, at the corner of Boyce&rsquo;s Street,
just below which, in Ashby Court, lived an old matchman, a
well-known character of the town.</p>
<p>Although &ldquo;Lucifers&rdquo; have almost rendered null and
void the flint, steel, and tinder-box, yet in villages the
brimstone-tipped bunches of flat matches are even now extant, and
age picks up a scant existence in vending them from door to door,
to dames who pride themselves upon their antiquated notions and
doing what their good mothers did before them; their almost
sacred observance being always to have hot embers on their social
hearth, from which by means of a common match, a light may always
be obtained.</p>
<p>In Brighton, the most celebrated of the match-vending craft,
was John Standing, familiary known as &ldquo;Old Rosemary
Lane,&rdquo; from the following song which he incessantly uttered
while pursuing his daily avocation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There was an old &rsquo;oman<br />
In Rosemary Lane,<br />
She cuts &rsquo;em and dips &rsquo;em<br />
And I do the same.</p>
<p>Come, buy my fine matches<br />
Come, buy &rsquo;em of me,<br />
They are the best matches<br />
&rsquo;Most ever you see.</p>
<p>For lighting your candle<br />
Or kindling your fire<br />
They are the best matches<br />
As you can desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standing was a native of Hurstperpoint, where for some years
he followed the occupation of a bricklayer, and was considered a
good workman; but having had the misfortune to fall from a
scaffold when about 30 years old, he was disabled from his usual
employment, as he by the accident received a severe injury to the
spine, <a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>which ever after prevented him from assuming an erect
posture; and one of his eyes was knocked out, his thumb was
broken and reversed, and he was otherwise much mutilated.</p>
<p>At first his business circuit with matches was through the
villages under the hill, where he was very well known; but other
venders, of the gipsey tribe, combining to drive him off their
ground by underselling him, he moved on to Brighton, where his
injured bodily condition and the novelty of his ditty obtained
him a good trade, and in a very short time many regular
customers.&nbsp; In fact, to the outward world his prospects
appeared so thriving, that many persons asserted he was,
miser-like, accumulating a fortune; for although he never asked
alms, his lame, blind, and aged condition excited sympathy
amongst strangers, who rather gave to him than purchased of
him.</p>
<p>John was married; but his wife, who was also aged, was not
without her share of misfortunes.&nbsp; She was the manufacturer
of the establishment, and being exposed to hard work and the
rigour of a severe winter, the cold so affected her limbs that it
was found necessary to amputate one of her legs, and, also remove
nearly all the toes from the other foot, from their becoming
frostbitten; added to which, she by an accident lost an
eye.&nbsp; In January, 1833, Standen was taken suddenly ill in
East Street, during one of his morning perambulations, and in a
few days, on the 9th of February, he terminated his life, after
having for nearly 40 years traversed the town, singing his
unvaried song, day by day, through all weathers.&nbsp; His wife
survived him but three days, the shock, occasioned by his death,
being too severe for her shattered constitution to
withstand.&nbsp; They were borne together to their grave in the
Old Churchyard, by some kind neighbours, their coffins having
been provided by the parish.</p>
<p>The house, the Albany Tavern, at the top of Duke Street,
commanding the view of the sea, down West Street, was for many
seasons during the abode of George IV. in Brighton, the residence
in lodgings, of Johnny Townsend, the noted Bow Street Runner, who
was in constant attendance for a long series of years, upon the
Royal Personage when he was Prince of Wales and King.&nbsp; West
Street at that period was a place of fashionable resort,
especially for <a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>equestrians, Royal blood daily frequenting it, and
often paying a visit to Townsend, with whom they frequently
essayed to luncheon, the viands for the occasion being sent up
from the Royal Pavilion.&nbsp; Townsend was a shrewd but
illiterate man, a staunch politician of the Tory school,
kind-hearted, generous, and charitable, an agreeable companion
with his equals, a man who commanded the respect of his superiors
and his inferiors; but he was a sore terror of refractory boys
and girls.</p>
<p>In the house immediately above Duke Street, and directly
opposite Cranbourne Street, lived, on his retirement from
business, Mr. Beach Roberts, a Brighton celebrity, who, at the
commencement of the present century was a tinman, carrying on a
respectable and lucrative business upon the premises now occupied
by Mr. B. Lewis, silversmith, Ship Street.&nbsp; In his latter
days he was termed the &ldquo;Walking Newspaper,&rdquo; inasmuch
as he was acquainted with all&mdash;and sometimes more than all,
of the news of the day.&nbsp; On the 13th March, 1810, some
person, by way of a hoax, inserted in the London papers, the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Died, yesterday, Beach Roberts,
Esq.,&mdash;a gentleman who had enjoyed a wider sphere of
connexion in the County of Sussex than most men, who had been
elected to the office of High Constable of this Parish seven
different times; for the last twelve years been foreman of the
Grand Jury at the Quarter Sessions at Lewes; and who has left one
hundred thousand pounds; ten thousand of which are to be applied
to charitable purposes within the limits of the town; one
thousand towards the support of the Magdalen Hospital, and the
remainder to be equally divided between his son and
daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hoax became the current topic of the
day, and subjected Mr. Roberts to several congratulatory
addresses from his friends; as he was at the time about
forty-five years of age, in the enjoyment of good health, and of
a promising constitution.&nbsp; It may be added that he never
served the office of High Constable, and that he had no
children.</p>
<p>In the house next above that wherein Mr. Roberts lived, for
some little time resided&mdash;carrying on the business of a
butcher,&mdash;James Ings, who on the 23rd of February, 1820,
was, on the information of a confederate, apprehended with eight
others, in a hay-loft, in Cato Street, Paddington, for being
concerned in a plot <a name="page335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>to destroy the Ministers of the
King, while at a cabinet dinner that evening in Grosvenor Square,
London, at the residence of the Earl of Harrowby, the President
of the Council.&nbsp; The plot is known as the Cato Street
Conspiracy, wherein Ings took so conspicuous a part that it was
arranged that on their leader, Arthur Thistlewood, presenting a
parcel at the door of Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s house, he should head
the rest of the conspirators, rush in where the company were
assembled, and massacre the whole of them indiscriminately.&nbsp;
Just previous to their apprehension Ings prepared himself for the
desperate enterprise, by putting a black belt round his waist and
another over his shoulders; he also put on two bags like
haversacks, and placed a pair of pistols in his belt.&nbsp; Then
looking at himself with an air of exultation he exclaimed,
uttering an oath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not complete now; I have
forgot my steel;&rdquo; whereupon he seized a large knife, about
twelve inches long, and, brandishing it about, swore he would
bring away two heads in his bags, and one of Lord
Castlereagh&rsquo;s hands, which he would preserve in brine, as
it might be thought a good deal of hereafter.&nbsp; The whole of
the conspirators were found guilty of High Treason, and on the
morning of the first of May, Thistlewood, Ings, and three others
were hanged and decapitated at Newgate; the rest of the traitors
were transported.</p>
<p>The executioner of these misguided men was James Botting, a
native of Brighton, and son of Jemmy Botting, the possessor of
some small property at the back of West Field Lodge, immediately
to the west of the bottom of Cannon Place, and known as
Botting&rsquo;s Rookery, from its being the resort of tramps of
the lowest order.&nbsp; Botting also, on the 30th of November,
1824, at Newgate, carried out the last penalty of the law upon
Henry Fauntleroy, the banker, who formerly had his residence at
the west end of Codrington Place, Western Road, and was found
guilty of uttering a forged deed with intent to defraud Frances
Young of &pound;5,000 Stock, and a power of attorney to defraud
the firm of Marsh, Stacey, Fauntleroy, and Graham, Bankers,
Berner&rsquo;s Street, London, of which house he was the acting
partner.</p>
<p>For several years previous to his decease, which took place at
Brighton, October 1st, 1837, Botting, in consequence of paralysis
retired from his situation as public hangman, the latter days of
his <a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>existence being eked out by a pension of five shillings
a week, granted by the Court of Aldermen of the City of London,
for whom, in the course of his duties, he had deprived 175
&ldquo;parties&rdquo;&mdash;as he termed them&mdash;of their
lives; as during his career executions at Newgate were very
common, the offences for which life was forfeited being so
numerous that in one week thirteen persons, namely, eight on
Wednesday, November 23rd, and five on the Tuesday following,
November 29th, 1821, suffered, none of the crimes for which they
were executed&mdash;thanks to the enlightenment of our
legislators,&mdash;now exacting as a penalty the life of a fellow
creature.&nbsp; Botting, in his latter days, was a well known
character about Brighton, the streets of which he was accustomed
to traverse by means of a chair, which he alternately used as a
species of crutch, and as a seat, but he always appeared isolated
from the world, as no grade of society seemed ambitious of the
acquaintance of Jack Ketch.</p>
<p>The most commodious and commanding family mansions of the Old
Town are in West Street, wherein have resided, during the past
forty years, several of the magistrates and the clergy, and many
members of the medical profession of Brighton.&nbsp; At the
present time several of the houses are occupied by opulent
families: and the lanes and courts which formerly on its west
side detracted from the general respectability of the street,
having been demolished, the property thereabouts has become
considerably enhanced in value, and is much sought after.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XXIX.<br />
THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, CHARITIES, AND ENDOWMENTS.</h2>
<p>It is the pride of the inhabitants that no town in the kingdom
possesses so many Public Institutions for the general well-being
of the community, as Brighton.</p>
<p><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>Foremost amongst these, though a National Institution
and but co-equal with similar other branches to complete its
general working throughout the kingdom, is the Post Office,
which, in all probability, originally formed a part of the
General Postal systems as established in 1657 and 1660.&nbsp; We
have no authority as to the primitive mode of conveyance of
letters, but doubtless it was on horseback, and afterwards by
mail cart, as &ldquo;A Description of Brighthelmston&rdquo; <a
name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337"
class="citation">[337]</a> mentions:&mdash;&ldquo;During Summer
the post sets out from Brighthelmston for London every morning
(excepting Saturday) at nine o&rsquo;clock; and arrives there
every evening (excepting Monday) about seven.&nbsp; In the Winter
season the post goes out at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night on
Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; and returns from
London about eight on Thursday and Saturday
mornings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Post Office was then at
Widgett&rsquo;s, afterwards Crawford&rsquo;s, and then
Fisher&rsquo;s Library, Old Steine, the present premises of Mr.
Shaw, confectioner, from whence, upon the throwing of the
Promenade Grove into the Royal Domain, in 1803, it was removed to
premises constructed in the Grove gateway at the top of
Prince&rsquo;s Place, when Mr. J. Redifer was appointed the Post
Master.&nbsp; During the time that Crawford was Post Master, his
son, one of the present Members of Parliament for the city of
London, was the only letter-carrier in Brighton.&nbsp; Mail
coaches between London and Brighton were not put on the road till
1807.&nbsp; On the 22nd September, 1822, the Post Office was
removed to 67, East Street, where it continued till June, 1827,
when the premises, 149, North Street, were appropriated for the
business.&nbsp; From thence, on the 23rd of September, 1831, it
was removed to the house immediately south of the Unitarian
Chapel, New Road, Mr Ferguson being the Post Master.</p>
<p>The uniform charge for letters of one penny per half
ounce,&mdash;introduced in 1840, by Mr. Rowland Hill,&mdash;and
afterwards the abolition of the newspaper duty, when the postage
of the public journals, and subsequently and now all printed
works passing at the rate of one penny for four ounces, rendering
the premises in the New Road inadequate to the increase of
business, the Post Office, <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>on the 26th of March, 1849, was
removed to the present site, opposite Trinity Chapel, in Ship
Street.&nbsp; The premises there were very narrow and contracted,
till August, 1858, when the present commodious structure was
erected.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Whiting, the present Post Master,
entered upon his duties in October, 1850.&nbsp; Previous to the
postage reduction, letters in the out districts of Brighton were
collected every evening by bellmen, who, for one penny, conveyed
letters to the General Office.&nbsp; Branch offices superseded
the bellmen, or collectors; and now, pillar-boxes, placed with
great discretion in all parts of the town, have rendered the
branch offices in some localities wholly unnecessary.&nbsp; The
first pillar letter-box in the kingdom was erected at the corner
of Fleet Street and Farringdon Street, London, in March,
1855.&nbsp; The Post Office Savings Bank opened at Brighton on
the 10th of March, 1862.</p>
<p>The first Bank in Brighton&mdash;the Old
Bank,&mdash;immediately opposite the premises subsequently and
now the Union Bank, was established in 1787, under the firm,
Messrs. Shergold, Michell, Rice, and Mills.&nbsp; It withstood
the panic of 1825; but a few years after, transferred its
declining business.&nbsp; The New Bank was the next established,
the firm being Messrs. Wigney, Rickman, Stanford, and
Vallance.&nbsp; Wigney, who was also a brewer, happening one day
to meet the builder of the sea wall of the Junction Road, Mr
Bennett, upon whom Dame Fortune rather frowned than smiled, said,
&ldquo;Why, Bennett, surety, if I remember right, you also, were
once a brewer?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bennett,
&ldquo;but I made a sad mistake, Wigney; I turned at the same
time a builder instead of, as you did, a banker; thus I have
always continued a needy man, from not having other
people&rsquo;s money to speculate with.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
rejoinder was very significant, as the sequel proved.&nbsp; The
Bank was at first in Steine Lane, with a second public entrance
by the side way to the Pavilion Shades; from whence, in 1819, it
was transferred to the apartments, now the coffee room of the
Pavilion Hotel, Mr. Edmund Savage, who had obtained the license
in 1816, having arranged with the bankers that they should
rebuild the house in the Castle Square front, so that they might
have the Bank on the ground-floor of the new building, and give
up the rooms in Steine Lane, in exchange.&nbsp; The room where
the banking business had been transacted, <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>Mr. Savage
then appropriated to a smoking-room, and converted the
clerks&rsquo; room into a Gin-shop.&nbsp; But as Mrs. Fitzherbert
was then living immediately opposite, in Steine Lane, he was
fearful of offending her by placing any writing on the house; the
thought, however, struck him, that, inasmuch as the height of Mrs
Fitzherbert&rsquo;s house, to the south of him, prevented the
<i>sun</i> from <i>shining</i> upon his house, he would adopt the
word &ldquo;Shades,&rdquo; and place it over the door, where had
before been written &ldquo;Bank,&rdquo; that being the only word
used to publish the place.&nbsp; An immense trade was soon
carried on in that little room, where three young men found full
employment in serving at the counter, and two as porters were
engaged besides.&nbsp; The extensive trade thus obtained soon
induced other publicans to adopt the word &ldquo;Shades&rdquo; to
their bars; and at the present time there is scarcely a
public-house in the kingdom but uses the term.&nbsp; The only
place previously where the word &ldquo;Shades&rdquo; was adopted
was at a Vault near Old London Bridge, where nothing was sold but
wine measured from the wood.</p>
<p>When known as Wigney&rsquo;s Bank, from the other partners
having withdrawn from the firm, the banking business was carried
on at the premises which occupied the western entrance of the
Avenue in East Street.&nbsp; Mr. Isaac Newton Wigney, M.P., who
was then sole proprietor, to the dismay and ruin of many of the
inhabitants, stopped payment on the 4th of March, 1842.&nbsp; The
chief clerk of the New Bank, as it was originally constituted,
was Mr. Thomas West, who, on the 1st of August, 1805, with
Messrs. Browne, Hall, and Lashmar, founded the Union Bank, their
neighbour, Mr. Daniel Constable, being the first person to open
an account with them; Messrs. Hall, Lloyd, Bevan, and West
constitute the present firm.&nbsp; Mr. Lashmar left the Union
Bank, and, in conjunction with Mr. Mugridge, opened the Sussex
Bank, in St. James&rsquo;s Street, which closed its doors on the
pressure of the panic of 1825.</p>
<p>The panic was also the death-blow to the County Bank, at the
south-east corner of Castle Square, which a few years previous
had been opened by Messrs. Tamplin, Creasy, and Gregory, the
latter,&mdash;who was the manager of the concern,&mdash;being the
noted Barnard Gregory, who alternately was a banker&rsquo;s
clerk&mdash;at Masterman&rsquo;s, <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>London, and Wigney&rsquo;s,
Brighton,&mdash;wine merchant, chemist and druggist, editor of
the <i>Brighton Gazette</i>, chapel building speculator,
theatrical performer, manager of the Sussex and Brighthelmston
Fire Insurance Company, and finally, as a public man, proprietor
and editor of an infamous London newspaper, the <i>Satirist</i>,
for a frightful calumny published in which, on the ex-Duke of
Brunswick, he was incarcerated one year in Newgate.&nbsp; Later
in a life which has but recently terminated, he speculated on a
second wife, an elderly maiden lady, the daughter of Mr.
Thompson, a wealthy public-house broker, of the Priory,
Hampstead.&nbsp; The circumstance of his marriage with this poor
lady is an illustration of the character of the man.&nbsp; He was
passing the evening with some friends, when the facility of
getting a wife became the topic of conversation, Gregory spoke
with his usual confidence: he could get a wife whenever he
pleased&mdash;at a day&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Being rallied on his
vanity, he offered to lay a wager that he would be married, and
to a woman of reputation, before the next night.&nbsp; The wager
was accepted&mdash;the stakes deposited.&nbsp; Gregory was the
winner.&nbsp; Before the next day was over he had proposed, was
accepted, had a wife, and, in compliance with the conditions of
the wager, had brought her to Brighton from London, where the
marriage was solemnised, before the close of the twenty-four
hours.</p>
<p>The London and County Bank, Pavilion Buildings, a branch of
the London and County Joint-Stock Banking Company, Lombard
Street, London, first opened in Brighton, at the south-east
corner of Prince&rsquo;s Place, in 1838.&nbsp; It removed to the
present premises in 1853.&nbsp; Mr. John Geddes Cockburn is the
Manager.</p>
<p>The Brighton Savings&rsquo; Bank was established in Duke
Street, at the top of Middle Street, in 1817, with Mr. George
Sawyer as Actuary.&nbsp; His successor, Richard Buckoll, became a
defaulter, and absconded.&nbsp; Mr. William Hatton is the present
Actuary, and the business is carried on in the New Road, upon
premises erected by Mr. John Fabian, to the plan of Mr. Baxter,
architect, on the site of the Royal Pavilion ice-well.&nbsp; Upon
its removal from Duke Street, the Bank occupied a portion of the
property on the east side of Prince&rsquo;s Place.</p>
<p>No other Banks are now in existence in Brighton.&nbsp; The
Unity <a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>Joint-Stock Mutual Banking Association, about four
years since, had a branch of their establishment at the
north-east corner of North Street, but its business was so
limited that it soon closed its doors.&nbsp; The National
Savings&rsquo; Bank Association (limited), 1, Pavilion Buildings,
had for a time a puny existence, and then, on becoming
amalgamated with a like institution, was lost to public
notice.&nbsp; The Bank of Deposit,&mdash;branches of which were
in all parts of the kingdom; and the Parent Office in Pall Mall,
London,&mdash;on premises next to the London and County Bank,
held a position in public confidence for some years; but in 1861,
in consequence of Peter Morrison, the Manager, becoming a
defaulter and a bankrupt, and eventually absconding, many
hundreds of depositors were irretrievably ruined.&nbsp; The
District Savings&rsquo; Bank, contiguous to the Odd
Fellows&rsquo; Hall, Queen&rsquo;s Road, after enjoying an
unenviable notoriety, and involving many small capitalists in
pecuniary difficulties, in 1861 abruptly closed.&nbsp; Bill
discounters and usurious money-lenders abound in the town, their
business being principally amongst those whose bills and
promissory notes are not recognised by the regular bankers, who
abstain from transactions that afford a probability of
proceedings in the County Court; hence exorbitant bonuses and
interest&mdash;which no fair trading can meet&mdash;are exacted,
and the non-fulfilment of payment becomes the precursor of
ruin.</p>
<p>The Fourth Estate of the Kingdom, the Press, is, for
independence of principles, well represented in Brighton.&nbsp;
The oldest locally established of this important institution is
the <i>Brighton Herald</i>, first published in September, 1806,
the proprietors being Mr. Matthew Phillips and Mr. H. R. Attree.
at 9, Middle Street, under the editorship of Mr. Robert
Sicklemore.&nbsp; Its price was seven pence, and such was the
size of the sheet&mdash;upon each of which there was a stamp of
three pence half-penny, besides a duty of three shillings and six
pence upon every advertisement,&mdash;that it did not contain
more than a quarter the matter now sold for two pence.&nbsp; From
Middle Street the publishing office was removed to 13, North
Street, from whence, after between two and three years, it was
removed to premises on the site now occupied by 114, in the same
street, immediately opposite the North Street Brewery.&nbsp;
Since March 25th, 1810, the <i>Brighton Herald</i> has been
printed and published <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>in Prince&rsquo;s Place, by Mr.
William Fleet, who, about twenty years since was joined by his
son, Mr. Charles Fleet.</p>
<p>The first number of the <i>Brighton Gazette</i> was printed
and published on premises beneath Donaldson&rsquo;s Library, Old
Steine, on the 22nd of February, 1821, by Mr. Edward Hill
Creasy.&nbsp; In November of the same year the business was
removed to the premises, 168, North Street, where it has ever
since continued to be published.&nbsp; On January 22nd, 1824, Mr.
John Baker became part proprietor, and on the 26th of February,
1835, it was first printed in Church Street, at the office
adjoining the National Schools.&nbsp; The last publication of the
<i>Brighton Gazette</i> with the name of Mr. Creasy attached
thereto, was on the 18th of July, 1844, only a few months prior
to his decease.&nbsp; On the 28th of December, 1848, the paper
first bore the name of the present publisher, Mr. Charles Curtis,
and in the Autumn of 1852, the printing office was removed to the
Pavilion Dormitories.&nbsp; In professed opposition to the
<i>Brighton Gazette</i>, the <i>Brighton Chronicle</i> was
published on Wednesday, the 6th of June, 1821, at 3,
Prince&rsquo;s place, by Mr. Cummins; its career, however, was
very short.</p>
<p>The <i>Brighton Guardian</i> made its first appearance under
the management and editorship of Mr. Levi Emanuel Cohen, on the
31st of January, 1827.&nbsp; It was enlarged on the 30th of
November, 1830, and, on the 1st of January, 1851, it appeared as
an eight page&mdash;small size&mdash;publication.&nbsp; In its
present size it was first published on the 3rd of October,
1853.&nbsp; From the day of its first issue to the present time,
the printing and publication have taken place on the same
premises, 34, North Street.&nbsp; For some years prior to the
decease of Mr. Cohen, which took place on the 17th of November,
1860, the <i>Brighton Guardian</i> was his sole property.&nbsp;
His brother, Mr. Nathan Cohen, is the present proprietor.&nbsp;
Strong party feeling, some few years since, started the
<i>Brighton Patriot</i>, in opposition to the <i>Guardian</i>;
but its existence was very ephemeral.</p>
<p>The <i>Brighton Examiner</i>, which since its first issue,
January 18th, 1853, has continued the property of Mr. J. F.
Eyles, was originally published at 33, Western Road; from whence
it was removed to its present printing and publishing office, in
North Street, opposite the Queen&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>Consequent upon the abolition of the newspaper duty,
the <i>Brighton Observer</i>&mdash;the original of the local
cheap press,&mdash;made its appearance at 54, West Street, on the
28th of November, 1856.&nbsp; It was first enlarged on the 27th
of November, 1857.&nbsp; On the 28th of December, 1858, the
printing and publication of the <i>Brighton Observer</i>, the
property of Mr. Ebenezer Lewis, took place at 16, King Street,
where, on the 30th of September, 1859, it was again enlarged; and
on the 25th of July, 1862, the office was removed to the premises
where it is at present printed and published, 53a, North Street,
the building which was originally the first Theatre in Brighton,
and, then, in 1790, the printing-office of Messrs. William and
Arthur Lee.</p>
<p>The only other local newspaper now in existence is the
<i>Brighton Times</i>, printed and published by Mr. William
Pearce, Bartholomews; established the 28th of April, 1860.&nbsp;
From time to time, since the repeal of the stamp duty,
speculators have started the <i>Sussex Mercury</i>, <i>Brighton
Chronicle</i>, &amp;c., but only as errors consequent upon the
lack of experience, and upon the parade of great professions.</p>
<p>The Alms-Houses, those termed the Percy Alms-Houses, six in
number, immediately north of Hanover Crescent, and bearing along
their fa&ccedil;ade &ldquo;These Alms-Houses were erected and
endowed at the request of the late Philadelphia and Dorothy
Percy, 1796,&rdquo; were built by Mrs. Mary Marriott, for the
reception of a similar number of poor widows, of the Church of
England, who have received no parochial relief, agreeably to the
testamentary instructions of Mrs. Philadelphia and Mrs. Dorothy
Percy,&mdash;daughters of the Duke of Northumberland,&mdash;who
endowed them with the sum of &pound;48 per annum, which amount
was doubled upon the demise of Mrs. Mary Marriott.&nbsp; Two
gowns and a bonnet are also allowed to each widow every year, and
a Duffield cloak once in three years.&nbsp; By a bequest of Mr.
James Charles Michell, in 1833, the sum of &pound;1 16s. is added
to the endowment; and there is also &pound;300 invested by Mr.
Skinner, for repairs of vaults, and the surplus in coals.&nbsp;
Attached to the Percy Alms-Houses are other similar dwellings,
the two to the north and three nearest the south having been
erected by Mr. John Fabian, for Miss Wagner, the sister of <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>our much
respected Vicar, conjointly with whom was built that which bears
on its face the following inscription: &ldquo;1861.&nbsp; In
pious remembrance of the late Marquis of Bristol.&nbsp; M. A.
W.&mdash;H. M. W.&rdquo; pleasingly expressive of the purport of
its erection.</p>
<p>In unison with this grateful memento, the annexed address of
condolence was presented to the present Marquis:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The Rev. the Vicar of
Brighton, to the Marquis of Bristol,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Brighton Vicarage, February 24,
1859.</p>
<p>My dear Lord,</p>
<p>Enclosed is an address of condolence on the part of the
Brighton Clergy.&nbsp; I make myself responsible for the
signature of Mr. Henry Elliott, now on the Continent, because I
know his deep feeling of affectionate gratitude to your venerated
Father, from whom he, like myself, received countless
benefits.</p>
<p>I have the honour to remain, my dear Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your Lordship&rsquo;s ever faithful
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">H. M. <span
class="smcap">Wagner</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO THE MARQUIS OF BRISTOL,<br />
ADDRESS OF CONDOLENCE ON THE PART OF THE CLERGY OF BRIGHTON.</p>
<p>Through a long period of time we have been connected with your
Father by so many holy and endearing associations, that we hope
you will allow us the privilege of a fellowship with you even in
the deep affliction which it has pleased God now to send upon
you.&nbsp; We know that sympathy belongs indeed to One, and we
earnestly pray that He, who only can, will make all grace and
comfort abound to your own heart, and to the hearts of all your
family, under your present bereavement.</p>
<p>But while we thus feel how little worth is all human
consolation in our hours of deepest sorrow, we nevertheless trust
that it may not be unacceptable to you at this time to receive,
as certainly it is most pleasant to us to render, the united
tribute of our respectful gratitude to the memory of your
venerated father.&nbsp; Associated as he was with us for so many
years as a parishioner, friend, and a benefactor, there are few
who can appreciate, as we can, the extent and the
self-forgetfulness and the humility of his singular
benevolence.</p>
<p>It would be very difficult for us to give adequate expression
to our sense of the devotedness with which he used his high
station, his property, and his influence for the promotion of
those holiest interests of religion and charity, of which we are
in some measure the guardians and representatives in this
Parish.&nbsp; There are very few of us who have not personally
experienced, in some good word or work, the great kindliness of
your father&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; To the poor, his whole life
copied Him who &ldquo;went about doing good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very
many are there of the humblest and most indigent, who would be
the first to testify that they ever found in the Marquis of
Bristol a brother&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; While the monuments of his
munificence which stand forth amongst us, the record to many
generations of his pious care for the souls, and bodies of his
fellow men, are, we believe, well nigh unparalleled in any
parish, the Sussex County Hospital, with its commodious <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>Chapel, the
Church of St. Mark, our Parish Church in its restored beauty, and
our two Cemeteries, with many other noble or sacred Institutions
scarcely less than these,&mdash;all associated with his
name,&mdash;bear witness, not only to his vast beneficence, but
to the wisdom also with which he selected the channels in which
that beneficence should flow.&nbsp; And over all he threw such a
suavity of manner and beautiful simplicity, that it was only when
the action had passed that we woke up to the discovery of its
greatness, which the grace of his presence had forbidden us to
see.</p>
<p>Accept, then, at our hands the assurance of the sorrowing
affection, not of ourselves alone, but of a whole parish, which
feels itself, like you, bereaved; and permit us to add the
prayer, that your father&rsquo;s God may pour upon you, and upon
your children, and upon your children&rsquo;s children, the rich
inheritance of that father&rsquo;s spirit of universal love.</p>

<p>What may be very appropriately termed the Wagner
Alms-Houses&mdash;which are without endowment,&mdash;are for the
benefit of unmarried women,&mdash;spinsters,&mdash;above the age
of fifty, and who possess, or are ensured the yearly income of
&pound;15 at the least.</p>
<p>Howell&rsquo;s Alms-Houses, which are not yet endowed, are
situated in an open space of ground approached by iron gates on
the west side of George Street.&nbsp; They are eight in number,
and in <a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>the centre of the block of buildings, surmounted by a
dial, is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">HOWELL&rsquo;S ALMS
HOUSES,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Erected</i> 1859.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Supported by voluntary
Contributions, for the reception of reduced Inhabitants of
Brighton and Hove, under the regulation of a Committee of
Management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inmates of these houses are elected by the donors and
subscribers, and all persons not under 60 years of age, who have
resided in Brighton or Hove at least ten years previous to the
time of election, and have not received parochial relief during
such period, are eligible.</p>
<p>These were built by Charles Howell, Esq., Dial House, Hove,
upon ground valued at &pound;1,000.&nbsp; It was the original
intention of this philanthropic gentleman to have bequeathed the
ground and the money for the erection of the houses, by will; but
with the very laudable desire of seeing his benevolent intention
realized during his life time, Mr. Howell preferred perfecting
his work himself, and he has vested the property in the following
Trustees:&mdash;Henry Michell Wagner, Vicar of Brighton; Charles
Wellington Howell, Robert Upperton, jun., John Pankhurst, and
Piercy George Pankhurst.&nbsp; He has also conveyed to the above
named trustees two houses in George Street, the rents of which,
about &pound;26 a-year, are charged, first with the repairs of
the Alms-Houses, and then for the general purposes of the
Charity.</p>
<p>The original plan provides for five more houses; for the
erection of which and the endowment of the whole thirteen the
co-operation of the public is solicited.&nbsp; May the anxious
wish of Mr. Howell that the whole of the buildings be completed
and permanently endowed, before it pleases the Almighty to remove
him from this sphere of his benevolent acts, he speedily
realised.</p>
<p>For mutual benevolence no institution has a firmer basis than
the Manchester Unity, I.O.O.F., whose Hall for the Brighton
district, forms a prominent feature of the Queen&rsquo;s Road,
where the first stone of the building was laid on the 27th of
June, 1853, by Mr. Tamplin, the then High Constable of
Brighton.&nbsp; Mr. John Fabian was the builder of the edifice,
upon a piece of ground which was purchased for &pound;500 of the
Rev. James Edwards.&nbsp; The building <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>proceeded
without interruption until the 27th of August, when a Bill in
Chancery, to restrain the erection, was filed by Mr. Alderman
Patching, who possessed property and resided immediately opposite
the Hall.&nbsp; The building was thus delayed; but, on the 4th of
November, an appearance was put in on behalf of the Building
Committee, when the case, Patching <i>v.</i> Dubbins, came on for
hearing before Vice Chancellor Sir Page Wood.&nbsp; The
plaintiff&rsquo;s plea was, that in the covenant under which he
bought the ground upon which his premises stood, it was
stipulated that no building, except monuments or headstones,
should be erected on the plot of land opposite, which was an
unburied-in portion of the Hanover Burial Ground.&nbsp;
Defendant&rsquo;s counsel argued the fact that plaintiff had
permitted the erection of the Dispensary on a portion of the same
ground, and had allowed two months to expire since the building
was commenced before he filed his injunction; and further, that
the building was not opposite, but a foot or two to the north of
being opposite.&nbsp; The case was argued at length, and the Vice
Chancellor gave a verdict for defendant, with costs.</p>
<p>The building then proceeded; was formally opened on the 26th
of June, 1854; and its opening was shortly after celebrated with
a public banquet, at which the Mayor of Brighton, Lieut.-Colonel
Fawcett, presided.&nbsp; The total cost of the ground, building,
fittings, furniture, &amp;c., was &pound;3,000.&nbsp; Four Lodges
of the Order hold their meetings weekly in the Hall, and
endeavours are being made to establish Schools upon the premises
for the education, at a reasonable cost, of the children and
orphans of members.&nbsp; Five other Lodges meet in various parts
of Brighton and Hove.&nbsp; The first Lodge, 118, one of the
oldest belonging to the Unity, was established in Brighton, in
1822.&nbsp; The Widows and Orphans&rsquo; Fund, in connexion with
the District, has been in existence twenty-one years, having been
established in 1841, and its members, with very few exceptions,
include the whole of the members in the Brighton District.&nbsp;
It has an accumulated capital of over &pound;6,000, chiefly
invested in debentures on the rates of the town.</p>
<p>Lodges of the Brighton, London, and Nottingham Unities of Odd
Fellows, are held in various parts of the Borough, as are also
Lodges and Courts of the several Orders of Druids and
Foresters.</p>
<p><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>The
Free and Accepted Masons hold the Royal Clarence Lodge, No. 394;
the Royal Brunswick Lodge, 1,034; the Lennox Chapter Lodge, No.
338; and the Royal Sussex Chapter Lodge, No. 1,034, at the Old
Ship Hotel, where also the Lodge of Instruction is held.</p>
<p>The Brighthelmston Dispensary, now known as the Brighton and
Hove Dispensary, from a branch being established in the latter
parish, was founded under the patronage of the Prince of Wales,
November 27th, 1809.&nbsp; The Institution was opened on January
1st, 1810, on premises in Nile Street, contiguous to the Old
Vicarage, or, as it was then called, the Parsonage House.&nbsp;
In July 1811, it was removed to North Street, at the corner of
Salmon Court, opposite Ship Street, where in November, 1812, was
added the Sussex General Infirmary.&nbsp; Early in 1819, the
joint establishments were removed into Middle Street, the
premises now occupied by the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
Association, the purchase of which property was completed the
following year.&nbsp; The present noble building of the
Institution,&mdash;which is entirely supported by voluntary
contributions,&mdash;was built by Messrs. Cheesman,&mdash;Mr.
Herbert Williams, architect,&mdash;and was completed and occupied
in 1849, a committee of gentlemen, amongst whom Mr. Gavin E.
Pocock, surgeon, was most zealous, having with untiring energy
raised the means of entirely freeing the edifice from any
debt.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Governors and Subscribers of the
Dispensary, at the Old Ship Tavern, on the 10th of February,
1813, it having been announced that the Right Honourable the Earl
of Egremont, the Vice-President, had offered to contribute
&pound;1,000 towards the erection of a County Hospital, the
building of that Institution for the reception of sixty patients
was determined upon, and contributions from other noblemen and
gentlemen to the extent of another &pound;1,000 were at once
made.&nbsp; It was not, however, till the 11th of December, 1824,
that the erection of the building was fully determined upon; and
then the subscription of the noble Earl amounted to
&pound;2,000&mdash;afterwards increased to
&pound;3,000,&mdash;and that of Thomas Read Kemp, Esq.,
&pound;1,000 and the ground whereon the building stands.&nbsp;
The foundation stone of the main building was laid on the 16th of
March, 1826, by the Earl of Egremont, Sir Charles Barry being the
architect.&nbsp; The Adelaide wing, to the east, Mr. Herbert <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>Williams,
architect, and the Victoria wing to the west, Mr. William
Hallett, architect, have since been added.&nbsp; The Institution
is supported by legacies, benefactions, dividends of stocks, and
general voluntary contributions.</p>
<p>The Sussex and Brighton Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye was
formed at a public meeting of the inhabitants of Brighton and the
vicinity, held at the Bedford Hotel, August 27th, 1832, Dr. Jenks
being the physician, and Mr. (now Dr.) Pickford and Mr. Seabrook,
the surgeons.&nbsp; On the 12th of January, 1837, a resolution
was passed by the Governors of the Institution that severe cases
and those for operation should have admission into the house,
then in Boyce&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>The first stone of the present building, in the Queen&rsquo;s
Road, was laid on the 29th of June, 1846, by the Right Reverend
Father in God, Ashurst Turner, Lord Bishop of Chichester, from a
design after the temple of Theseus, from plans and specifications
prepared by Mr. Thomas Cooper, architect, the builders being
Messrs. Wisden and Anscombe.&nbsp; The cost of the site was
&pound;480, and of the structure &pound;1,273 7s., and the
business of the Institution was transferred from Boyce&rsquo;s
Street to the new building on the 10th of November, 1846.&nbsp;
At the annual meeting of the Governors, on the 14th of January,
1847, resolutions were passed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That the Silver Trowel, with which was laid, 29th
June, 1846, by the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, the first stone of
the building, erected for the purposes of the Charity, be
presented to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">James H.
Pickford</span>.&nbsp; Esq., M.D., M.R.I.A.</p>
<p>In acknowledgment of his successful efforts as the original
promoter of the Charity, of his unceasing exertions for the
general interests of the Institution, and in testimony of his
talent and ability as a Medical Officer.</p>
<p>That the foregoing resolution be engraved on the trowel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Pickford was, on the resignation of Dr. Jenks, appointed
physician, April 4th, 1853, and Mr. George Lowdell was then
elected surgeon.&nbsp; Upon the resignation of Dr. Pickford and
Mr. Seabrook, January 27th, 1859, the former was elected a
Vice-President, and the latter was appointed Consulting-Surgeon
to the Institution, which is supported by voluntary
contributions.</p>
<p>The Blind Asylum at Brighton had its origin in 1839, when Mr.
Moon the eminent teacher and printer for the Blind, becoming <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>deprived of
his sight, devoted his attention to the learning of embossed
reading; and such was his progress that he soon, with the
benevolent assistance of a lady, advanced sufficiently to assist
others in learning also, first at their own homes, and then in a
small class at his residence.&nbsp; At length, the number
becoming large, it was considered advisable to establish a daily
public school for the Blind in Brighton; and the use of a portion
of St. James&rsquo;s Sunday School-room was obtained for that
purpose.&nbsp; This School, in which were also a few Deaf and
Dumb children, was opened on the 22nd of October, 1839.&nbsp; In
the following Summer, a Committee of Ladies made an effort to
raise the means for opening an Asylum to receive as many of the
Blind and Deaf and Dumb of the number thus brought together, as
were desirous of partaking of the benefits which such an
Institution might afford.&nbsp; In the Summer of 1841, it was
deemed expedient to separate the Blind from the Deaf and Dumb,
which latter were retained in the Institution, but the Blind
pupils were re-formed into a daily school.</p>
<p>In 1842, the scholars were assembled for instruction in a
classroom of the Central National School; and eventually the Rev.
H. M. Wagner&mdash;the Vicar,&mdash;raised sufficient funds to
build premises contiguous, in Jubilee Street, for the reception
of twelve pupils, who were admitted to the Asylum, as it was then
termed, early in January, 1846.&nbsp; Year by year the number of
pupils increased, till at length, the accommodation on the
premises being wholly inadequate to the demand, the Rev. H. V.
Elliott, in the Summer of 1860, kindly gave the present site near
the County Hospital, for the erection of the New Asylum, to the
building fund of which the Rev. G. Oldham generously contributed
the munificent donation of &pound;2,000, while the proceeds of a
Bazaar amounted to &pound;1,000 more.&nbsp; The opening ceremony
took place on Tuesday, 22nd October, 1861.</p>
<p>Mr. G. Somers Clarke is the architect of the structure, which
is Italian Gothic, of Venetian character, and is built entirely
of brickwork with stone dressings.&nbsp; The front is very
fine.&nbsp; It has an elevation of four stories, and by a
somewhat liberal use of stonework an almost palatial aspect has
been imparted.&nbsp; The entrance is double, and in a finely
sculptured medallion over the door is an Angel of Mercy teaching
the Blind.&nbsp; The apex of the doorway arch is continued <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>into a
bracket whereon is placed a stone group of Charity Relieving the
Blind.&nbsp; In the adjacent carving are introduced the emblems
of Faith, Hope, and Charity&mdash;the two latter being
personified in the anchor and the pelican feeding its young from
its own body.&nbsp; The different stories are shown by graceful
mouldings on which rest the stonework of the windows.&nbsp; Those
belonging to the two middle stories are very massive, the elegant
proportioning of the columns dividing the four lights being
especially noticeable.&nbsp; The harmony of the whole work is
extremely good.</p>
<p>Mr. Moon, who, for his invention of a plan for teaching the
blind to read, has obtained a justly deserved world-wide fame,
continues his indefatigable exertions to ameliorate the condition
of his fellow-sufferers.&nbsp; Not only has he been enabled to
emboss the whole of the Bible in the English language, but
portions of it also in fifty more; and he is daily receiving
testimony from various parts of the world of the high
appreciation of his system, and of the rich consolations of many
of the blind who are thus enabled to read the Word of God for
themselves.</p>
<p>The Brighton Institution for the Deaf and
Dumb,&mdash;established in 1840,&mdash;first located at 12,
Egremont Place, in 1842, and from thence, in 1848, it was removed
to the present building, in the Eastern Road, Messrs. Cheesman
and Son being the architects and builders.&nbsp; The new wing was
added in 1854, Messrs. Wisden and Anscombe being the
builders.</p>
<p>Like the Blind Asylum, this Institution is supported by
voluntary contributions.&nbsp; It has received several small
benefactions, amongst them &pound;300 as a tribute of respect to
the memory of the late Mr. George Gainsford, by his son and
daughter, &ldquo;in dutiful remembrance of their
father.&rdquo;&nbsp; To perpetuate also, the memory of Miss
Mohun, who was deeply attached to the Institution, and unwearily
devoted her useful life and benevolent exertions in its behalf,
the &ldquo;Hester Mohun Fund&rdquo; has been commenced expressly
to aid in educating or apprenticing a few poor deaf and dumb
children.</p>
<p>The Asylum for Poor Female Orphans, instituted in 1822, and
established in the Western Road, near the corner of Crown Street,
for some years occupied the garden whereon now stands the north
<a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>side of
Glo&rsquo;ster Street.&nbsp; It was removed to its present
situation in the Eastern Road,&mdash;where so many monuments to
Benevolence are reared,&mdash;in 1853.&nbsp; The first stone of
the building was laid on the 16th of June.&nbsp; The design of
the Asylum is to save innocent and unprotected Female Orphans
from the too frequent misery attendant on idleness and poverty,
to instruct them in such branches of household employment and
needlework as may qualify them to become useful servants, while
care is taken that their instruction and employment shall be such
as it is hoped may render them honest and industrious members of
Society.</p>
<p>The Provident and Self-Supporting Dispensary was established
at 32, Middle Street, in 1837.&nbsp; Its object is to promote a
feeling of laudable independence among the working classes, that
they may help themselves, and so be prevented from seeking
charitable assistance from others; to encourage habits of
provident frugality; and to enable those to obtain immediate
relief who are not able to pay for it in the usual way, but are
not in circumstances so indigent as to justify an application to
the gratuitous Dispensary.</p>
<p>The Brighton and Hove Lying-in-Institution and Dispensary
established in High Street, in 1831, has appropriate premises at
76, West Street, and by the means of subscriptions and donations
affords the requisite assistance and comfort to poor women at a
time when the evils of poverty are most keenly felt.</p>
<p>The Dollar Society, instituted in November, 1813, is so called
from every annual subscription to that amount entitling the
subscriber to recommend one person yearly to become a partaker of
the fund, such recipient not to be a person deriving assistance
from parochial resources.&nbsp; The Society extends its kindness
to the chamber of sickness and the abode of unforeseen calamity,
and particularly to deserving persons bending beneath the
pressure of years.</p>
<p>The Maternal Society, formed 28th July, 1813, provides
childbed linen and other suitable articles of clothing, with
nourishment for poor lying-in married women, and such attentions
and comforts as their condition may require.</p>
<p>The Brighton Auxiliary Town Missionary and Scripture
Readers&rsquo; Society meet weekly at 25, Middle Street, with the
view <a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>to
extend the knowledge of the Gospel amongst the poor of the town,
without regard to denominational distinctions.</p>
<p>The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge is a district
Committee for the Deanery of Lewes, and was established in 1815,
under the sanction of the Bishop of the Diocese, to promote the
diffusion of the Scriptures and Religious Tracts amongst the
lower orders of society.&nbsp; The parent Society, in London, was
formed by members of the Church of England, in 1669.</p>
<p>The Provident and District Society, established in 1824, under
most admirable arrangements, gives direct charitable assistance;
encourages the poor to make deposits, which are returned to them
in winter in useful articles, with the amount increased by a
premium; and prevents mendicity by having an office, 108, Church
street, where beggars may be referred and have their cases
examined into.&nbsp; The Society has the town divided into
districts, for the purpose of visiting and inquiring into cases
of distress.&nbsp; The Benevolent Loan Fund, at the same office,
grants pecuniary assistance to those who, by misfortune, require
temporary aid; re-payments being arranged by easy instalments,
and not subjecting the borrowers to the usury of trading
money-lenders.</p>
<p>The Brighton and Sussex Mutual Provident Society, Prince
Albert Street, commenced its operations in January, 1847.&nbsp;
Its rules and tables provide weekly allowances and medical aid in
sickness; sums at death; endowments; and immediate and deferred
annuities; it is the only local institution of the kind.</p>
<p>Bowen, in his &ldquo;Complete System of Geography,&rdquo; <a
name="citation353"></a><a href="#footnote353"
class="citation">[353]</a> says, &ldquo;There are two
considerable charity schools here, one for 50 boys, who are
taught arithmetic and navigation, and 20 girls, who are put out
to apprenticeship or services.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were termed
Free Schools, and that for boys was founded within the precincts
of the Bartholomews, in 1725, by the Rev. Anthony Springett, who,
in addition to an annual subscription of 8s., in the year 1740
gave the further sum of &pound;25 per annum, for the education of
twenty poor boys belonging to the parish.&nbsp; In 1735, Mr.
George Beach left the interest of &pound;59 1s. 6d., and in 1781,
the Right Honourable the <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>Countess of Gower gave the interest
of &pound;234 12s. to the same charity.&nbsp; The money, however,
having been laid out in the short annuities, the funds were not
available to the intentions of the founder, the school-house,
therefore, and a small parcel of land adjoining, were sold for
&pound;400, and in February, 1818, another school, established
upon its foundation, in the Lanes immediately north of Black Lion
Street, was opened, under the denomination &ldquo;National School
for Boys,&rdquo; the premises being sufficiently commodious to
contain 300 youths, for education in reading, writing, and
arithmetic, and in the principles of the Established Church.</p>
<p>Another Free School was founded by Mr. William Grimmett, for
twenty boys, the children of parishioners, to be clothed, and
instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, merchants&rsquo;
accounts, navigation, and the principles of the Established
Church of England.&nbsp; Mr. Grimmett had been instructed in the
Free School founded by Mr. Springett; and having afterwards been
bred to the sea, he realized by his industry above &pound;10,000,
nearly &pound;2,000 of which&mdash;now accumulated to
&pound;2,330 11s. 6d., producing an income of &pound;69 18s.
4d.,&mdash;he bequeathed for the endowment of his School.&nbsp;
Some informality in his Will gave his heirs-at-law an opportunity
of contesting the legality of the bequest; but his widow
generously maintained against them a suit in Chancery, and the
validity of the Will was confirmed.&nbsp; But from the nature of
the bequest, and the disagreement that afterwards arose amongst
the appointed Trustees, the school was not established before
1769.&nbsp; It is now managed according to the directions of the
devisor, by sixteen Trustees, namely, the Vicar and three
Churchwardens of the Parish, and twelve other inhabitants of the
town, chosen at a Vestry meeting, among whom every vacancy by
death, resignation, or removal from the town, is in like manner
to be always supplied by public election of the majority of the
parishioners, convened at a Vestry meeting the 1st day of May
annually; and every vacancy in the School is supplied by the
election of the Trustees, or the greater part of them, by ballot,
at a public Vestry, of which notice shall be given on a Sunday at
the Parish Church, ten days at least before such meeting; no boy
to be received into the school under the age of eight, nor
permitted to remain there after the age of fifteen years.&nbsp;
Forty <a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>boys are now educated on this foundation, at the
National School, in which it is merged.</p>
<p>The most remarkable man in connexion with the Free School, as
founded by Mr. Springett, was Mr. John Grover, under whose care
for instruction the inhabitants obtained signal benefit.&nbsp; He
was born of poor parents in Brighton, about the year 1648, and
passed his infancy and early youth in the lowest drudgeries of a
country life, and it was while tending a flock on the hills
adjoining the town that his youthful mind was often employed in
exploring the power and relations of numbers; and when he was of
sufficient strength for the more laborious employments of
agriculture, the moments of his leisure were still dedicated to
study.&nbsp; On his spade and shovel, with a lump of chalk, he
worked his problems, and calculated the motions of the tides and
stars.&nbsp; The early acquirements of this self-taught
philosopher soon attracted public wonder and investigation;
indeed, his intellectual powers and industry could not pass
without some notice and patronage; and there is no doubt he was
chiefly assisted by the Scrase family, upon whose farm he was
employed, and the Rev. Mr. Falkner, the Vicar.&nbsp; Books,
paper, and time, were the only things his indefatigable genius
seemed to require; and with such aid he soon became one of the
best penmen and mathematicians of his time.&nbsp; Not long after
he had thus established his fame for useful and abstruse science,
he was appointed master of the school, and his unambitious breast
aspired to no higher distinction, as he was enabled to apply the
enthusiasm of his genius to the cultivation of his favourite
studies.&nbsp; This mode of instruction, being that suggested by
reason, not the initiative pedantry of schools, facilitated the
attainment of the several branches he taught.&nbsp; Navigation
being the most necessary and profitable science to the
inhabitants of Brighthelmston, he taught it with singular
conciseness and precision.&nbsp; Mr. Grimmett was amongst the
last of his pupils, as he died, universally respected, soon after
the commencement of the present century.</p>
<p>In 1788, in an apartment of the old Town Hall, a School of
Industry for Girls was established, under the patronage of Mrs.
Nathaniel Kemp and other ladies.&nbsp; It consisted of 150 girls,
70 of whom were clothed in green, educated, and carefully
initiated in <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>the sentiments and practice of religion and
industry.&nbsp; This School is that known as the National School,
the central or head building of which Institution, erected in
1829 by Messrs. Stroud and Mew, and subsequently enlarged by
Messrs. Cheesman, is in Church Street.&nbsp; The Gothic style of
architecture is preserved throughout.&nbsp; There is a shield
with a scroll over the arched doorway of the principal entrance
containing the Arms of the Town and the inscription
&ldquo;National Schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; Entering by the grand door
of the vestibule, three tiers of balconies present themselves,
having staircases leading to them and conducting to the several
suites of rooms.&nbsp; The hall, 50ft. high, is terminated by a
groined roof.&nbsp; The Boys&rsquo; School is approached by an
elegant flight of stone steps, the room is 75ft long, 35ft wide,
and 20ft high, well lighted from the west, and has also an
entrance in Regent Street.&nbsp; The Girls&rsquo; School-room,
which is of similar dimensions to the Boys&rsquo;, and
immediately above it, is approached by two additional flights of
stone stairs.&nbsp; It has a branch in Warwick Street, built by
Mr. Ackerson.&nbsp; The Infant Schools, in connection with the
National Schools, are in Upper Gardner Street, Kent&rsquo;s
Court, and Warwick Street.</p>
<p>Swan Downer&rsquo;s School was founded in 1819, under the will
of Mr. Swan Downer, who in 1811 left the sum of &pound;10,106
15s. 3d., for paying the expenses of providing a proper
School-house for the instruction of 20 poor girls of the parish
in needle-work, reading, and writing, and completely clothing
them twice in every year, each of such girls to have two suits of
clothes at or on their election or entrance.&nbsp; On the
foundation of the said school he also provided that out of the
interest and produce of the trust funds&mdash;&pound;303
4s&mdash;a salary of &pound;40 per annum should be paid to a
competent schoolmistress, and the surplus applied to the
education and clothing of fifty girls, which has, since 1859,
been carried on in a large room temporarily rented by the
Trustees in Windsor Street.&nbsp; The first school was in Gardner
Street, taken by the then Trustees at an annual rent of
&pound;30, and at a loss of something like &pound;400 in
appropriating the premises.&nbsp; A site for the erection of a
New School-house has been approved by the Trustees.&nbsp; It is
situated in North Street, adjoining Messrs. Smithers and
Son&rsquo;s Brewery, and has a frontage to the street of 33ft.,
and a depth of more than 60ft.&nbsp; <a name="page357"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 357</span>The situation thus selected combines
two essentials, proximity to the Parish Church, with which the
founder connected the charity, and a central position, so
important to a day-school for the children of the poor.&nbsp; The
Union Schools, in Middle Street, were founded by Mr. Edward Goff,
of Scotland Yard, London; that for girls by a donation of
&pound;400, in 1807, and that for boys by a legacy of &pound;200
the following year.&nbsp; These schools, which are supported by
voluntary contributions, were re-erected in 1837.&nbsp; The other
National Charity Schools, independent of Sunday Schools, are:
British Schools (Boys&rsquo; and Girls&rsquo;), North Lane;
Ragged School, Dorset Street; Ragged Schools, Spa Street and
Essex Street; St. John&rsquo;s Schools, Carlton Hill; St.
Nicholas&rsquo; Church Memorial School, Frederick Street; St.
Stephen&rsquo;s School; Bethel Arch, on the Beach, for
Fishermen&rsquo;s children; Wesleyan Schools, Nelson Row; St.
Mark&rsquo;s Church of England Schools, Rock Street; St.
Paul&rsquo;s, West Street.</p>
<p>There are several public educational establishments in the
town; the principal of which is the College.&nbsp; It was
established January, 1847, at the top of Portland Place, on the
premises now occupied by J. Jardine, Esq., LL.D., and known as
Portland House Boarding School.&nbsp; The foundation stone of the
present building, in Eastern Road, was laid on the 27th of June,
1848, by the Right Rev. Ashurst Turner Gilbert, D.D., Lord Bishop
of Chichester, assisted by the architect, Mr. G. G. Scott, of
London, and the builders, Messrs. Wisden and Anscombe.&nbsp; A
bottle was deposited under the stone containing various papers
connected with the College, and a copy of the <i>Times</i> of
that day.&nbsp; An elegant trowel, having a richly carved ivory
handle, and enclosed in a handsome mahogany case, was presented
to and used by the Lord Bishop on the occasion.&nbsp; At first
the principal front, which afforded accommodation for 300 pupils,
only was erected, since which has been built the Chapel and other
additions.&nbsp; The College is divided into two
departments&mdash;the senior and the junior.&nbsp; The pupils in
the senior department wear an academical dress.&nbsp; Students
are admitted into the two departments after nine and fifteen
years of age respectively.&nbsp; The education is of the very
highest order, and will bear a favourable comparison with that of
any other Institution in England.&nbsp; <a

Bishop of Chichester: Principal, the Rev. John Griffith.</p>
<p>A short distance to the east is St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, an
institution for educating the daughters of poor clergymen,
established in 1836.&nbsp; To the benevolence of the late Marquis
of Bristol the building of this institution is principally
attributable.&nbsp; His benefactions were not few nor small; they
were, from first to last, every one of them, the unsolicited
spontaneous effusion of his noble heart.</p>
<p>His Lordship&rsquo;s first gift was &pound;500,&mdash;to
purchase a site for the building, which was originally designed
to look east and west, with only frontage for the present lodge
and the carriage-drive to the Hall.&nbsp; On the land so bought
St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall stands.&nbsp; But before the excavations
for the first design were finished, it was judged best to turn
the building, so as to look north and south, and to purchase the
additional frontage to the south.&nbsp; The piece of land at the
back was given by Mr. Enos Durant.&nbsp; These together cost
&pound;1,100, in addition to the munificent gift of &pound;500
from the Marquis, which was given before a sod was turned.&nbsp;
In September, 1849, his Lordship gave to St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall
its drilling room, which before had been a painting room, as a
free gift; and, moreover, sold to St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, for
&pound;500 (about half its cost), No. 6, Hervey Terrace, which
had been connected with the drilling room.&nbsp; In 1842&ndash;3,
he gave a donation of &pound;200, to mitigate the loss which fell
on the Institution, in consequence of a secret and outstanding
mortgage on the play-garden and kitchen-garden, which had been
purchased for &pound;500.&nbsp; The Trustees were obliged to pay
&pound;700 more to reclaim the land, after it had been walled-in
and stocked.&nbsp; The last gift of his Lordship was a cottage
and half an acre of land at the north-west extremity of the
premises, together with his share of right in the road leading to
it.&nbsp; This gift was fully worth &pound;400, and was intended
as an encouragement for the establishment of an Infant St.
Mary&rsquo;s Hall, which has not yet been carried out.&nbsp;

THE CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.</h2>
<p>Immediately in connexion with St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, is St.
Mark&rsquo;s Church, Kemp Town.&nbsp; This is another instance of
the benevolence of the late Marquis of Bristol.&nbsp; In
1838&ndash;9, he conveyed to the Trustees of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Hall the land on which the Church now stands.&nbsp; After the
conveyance thereof, and when the land was no longer his own, such
was his zeal to hasten the erection of St. Mark&rsquo;s, that, at
the expense of some &pound;2,000, he actually built the carcase
of the Church, roofed it in, and glazed its windows.&nbsp; If the
Church Commissioners would have sanctioned it, he originally
designed entirely to build and complete the Church himself.&nbsp;
Baffled in that desire, and feeling at his age the uncertainty of
life, he made over the property to the Trustees of St.
Mary&rsquo;s Hall, in the confidence that the interests of that
Institution would induce them, sooner or later, to complete his
purpose.&nbsp; After eight years of ineffectual effort and
negociation, St. Mark&rsquo;s Church was at last finished, and
consecrated on St. Matthew&rsquo;s Day, September 21st, 1849; and
for some years his Lordship was a worshipper in that house of
prayer.&nbsp; The cost of its completion and of the endowment, in
addition to his Lordship&rsquo;s free gift of the site and the
carcase, was not far short of &pound;5,000.&nbsp; For this
expense one of the Trustees became personally responsible, on
account of the immense value of the Church, and its gratuitous
accommodation to St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The subscriptions
and collections entrusted to him amounted to &pound;4,832 5s.
8d., of which sum Lord Bristol contributed a benefaction of
&pound;500.</p>
<p>In grateful remembrance of his Lordship, a splendid Memorial
Window and Monumental Tablet were erected to his memory, in the
Church, in 1860.&nbsp; The expense of the Window was defrayed by
subscriptions, chiefly by the members of the congregation, and
that of the Tablet by the Rev. E. B. Elliott and Lawrence Peel,
Esq.</p>
<p>The Memorial Window is an elaborate work of art in the Gothic
style, the subjects of the paintings being well selected from
sacred history.&nbsp; The centre compartment has two
divisions.&nbsp; In <a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>the upper division is the ascending
Saviour, with His arms stretched out in the act of blessing His
Disciples.&nbsp; The lower division represents the figure of St.
Mark, writing the concluding verses of his Gospel.&nbsp; In the
north compartment, the subject is the Lord descending, after the
Paschal Supper with His Disciples, from Jerusalem towards
Gethsamane; the Disciples are sorrowing at the thoughts of His
speedy departure from them, and He is comforting them with the
hope of His going to prepare for their re-union in Heaven.&nbsp;
The south compartment contains a group of Disciples looking
towards the ascending Saviour, in the upper central window,
whilst two angels address them&mdash;as recorded in Acts I., ch.
ii.</p>
<p>The Monumental Tablet is of Caen stone, bearing the following

<p>The present Marquis of Bristol bore the expense of the
enclosure of the Chancel and the painting of the walls in a style
accordant with the new ornamental window, thus completing the
work.</p>
<p>The Chapel in Prince&rsquo;s Place, subsequently named by
special Act of Parliament the Chapel Royal, was projected
originally for the accommodation of the increasing number of
visitors, and especially to lull an outcry prevailing at the time
in consequence of the non-attendance of the heir apparent at any
place of worship during his periodical residence in
Brighton.&nbsp; The corner stone was laid with masonic honours by
H.R.H. George, Prince of Wales, K.G., G.M., &amp;c., on the 25th
November, 1793.&nbsp; Divine service was performed in the
building, which was unconsecrated until the year 1803, by various
clergymen connected with the Court, and only during the
season.&nbsp; Among them may be named Archbishop Moore, Bishop
Horsley, and Bishop Horne, the latter of whom preached his
celebrated published sermon there, on the text, &ldquo;The sea is
His, and He made it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Prince regularly attended,
and the chapel was thronged with the nobility and gentry.&nbsp; A
story is told that H.R.H finally took umbrage at some very
personal remarks spoken at him from the pulpit by the Rev. W.
Brooke, who had taken for his text the words, &ldquo;Thou art the
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. B. was then Curate of Brighton, and had
been suddenly requested to take the duty in consequence of the
indisposition of the appointed clergyman.&nbsp; The Prince never
again entered the chapel, and curiously enough Mr. Brooke soon
after quitted the established church and officiated for some
years in a building, erected by certain of his followers, in
Church Street.&nbsp; The last occupant of the Royal Closet was
H.R.H. the late amiable Princess Augusta, who died <a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>in London
in 1840.&nbsp; This chapel was the last place of public worship
in which H.R.H. was enabled to appear.&nbsp; In 1803, during the
incumbency of the Rev. T. Hudson, it was thought desirable by
him, as Vicar of Brighton, to secure the building as a Chapel of
Ease to the Parish Church, St. Nicholas.&nbsp; He held the
freehold, and obtained an Act, 43rd Geo. III., cap. 91,
constituting the Church a perpetual curacy, and reserving to
himself and his successors in the Vicarage the right of
nomination.&nbsp; The incumbent is subject solely to the
jurisdiction of the Bishop of Chichester, &ldquo;as if the curacy
of the said chapel were a presentative Vicarage.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
may be mentioned that under the special Act, the perpetual Curate
is required to solemnize baptisms and churchings (marriages are
exempted), and empowered to demand double the fees usually
received at the Parish Church for the like duties.&nbsp; After
Mr. Hudson&rsquo;s removal from Brighton, the lay property of the
chapel passed, by purchase, to his successor (Rev. Dr. R. J.
Carr) and others.&nbsp; The present proprietors are R. Sedly
Tilstone, Esq., of Alverstoke and Moulse-coombe, R. C. Cox, Esq.,
of Taunton, and Rev. Thomas Trocke, M.A., the present
Incumbent.&nbsp; The building externally is very plain, having
none other decoration than a fine cast of the Royal Arms in
patent stone, on the pediment over the central window in
front.&nbsp; The interior, however, is somewhat elegant.&nbsp;
The Royal Closet still remains, and the Pulpit, Desk, and Altar
arrangements are very handsome.&nbsp; Over the latter, there is a
valuable Painting of &ldquo;The Crucifixion,&rdquo; by Van Een, a
pupil of Vandyke.&nbsp; The organ has two sets of manuels.&nbsp;
There are sittings for about 800 persons, of which 150 are thrown
open to the public.</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s Church was commenced in 1824, the first
stone being laid the 8th of May.&nbsp; It is a beautiful Gothic
structure of Portland stone, embellished with various
decorations, and from its combined elegance and situation forms
one of the most striking features of the town.&nbsp; The interior
is divided into three aisles, the principal of which runs through
the body of the Church, leading from the chief entrance to the
altar, over which there is a magnificent stained glass window
representing the Evangelists and the Apostles, which was
presented by the Vicar, the Rev. H. M. Wagner.&nbsp; The Church
was designed by the late Sir Charles Barry, built by Mr. <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>Ranger, and
consecrated 27th January, 1828.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev. Thomas
Cooke, M.A.</p>
<p>The following are the names of the trees planted in St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church-yard, with their symbolical
description:&mdash;</p>

consecrate the pine:&rdquo;&mdash;in Pagan days it was
consecrated to Diana; <i>Bay</i>&mdash;the &ldquo;Laurus
Nobilis&rdquo; of the ancient warriors, the crown of our Poet
Laureates, a supposed protection from lightning, and a purifier
of pestilential air; <i>Laurel</i>&mdash;as an honourable badge
for those who bravely defend their country and their laws;

the best bulwark of our Church and State.</p>
<p>Of all the places of worship in the town not one has a more <a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>interesting
history attached to it than the Countess of Huntingdon&rsquo;s
Chapel&mdash;commonly known as North Street Chapel,&mdash;facing
the New Road.</p>
<p>Before entering into the particulars of this Chapel the
following anecdote may not be deemed uninteresting, as it is
somewhat connected with the subsequent motives of Lady
Huntingdon<a name="citation364"></a><a href="#footnote364"
class="citation">[364]</a> building a religious edifice in the
town:&mdash;In the year 1755, the illness of the youngest son of
the Countess induced her ladyship to come to Brighton for the
benefit of sea-bathing.&nbsp; About this time the following
singular circumstance occurred, which Lady Huntingdon related to
the Rev. A. M. Toplady, and which is extracted from the
manuscript in the Posthumous Works of that gentleman, published
by the executors in 1780:&mdash;&ldquo;A gentlewoman who lived a
little way out of Brighthelmston dreamt that a tall lady dressed
in a particular manner would come to that town, and be an
instrument of doing much good.&nbsp; It was about three years
after this dream that Lady Huntingdon came to Brighton.&nbsp; A
few days after her Ladyship&rsquo;s arrival, the above
gentlewoman met her in the street, and, making a full stop,
exclaimed &lsquo;Oh! Madam, you are come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lady H.,
surprised at the singularity of such an address from an entire
stranger, thought the woman was bereft of her senses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you know of me?&rsquo; asked the Countess.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Madam&rsquo; replied the gentlewoman, &lsquo;I saw you in
a dream three years ago, dressed just as you are now,&rsquo; and
proceeded in the relation of her dream to the Countess.&nbsp;
This person was, in consequence of her acquaintance with Lady H.,
converted in a few weeks, and died in the triumph of faith about
a year after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About three months after her Ladyship&rsquo;s arrival she
visited a poor soldier&rsquo;s wife who had just been delivered
of twins, and administered to her temporal and spiritual
wants.&nbsp; It happened that next to that room was an oven
belonging to a baker&rsquo;s shop, thither the people flocked for
bread.&nbsp; Overhearing the pious conversation, some of the poor
women sought and obtained admission, and from time to time they
met there and conversed on religious topics.&nbsp; The news of
the religious labours of a person of rank <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>was soon
scattered through the town, and the people began to be anxious of
doing more good than was yet accomplished.&nbsp; The Countess
sent for her Chaplain, the Rev. George Whitefield.&nbsp; He came,
and preached his first sermon in a field at the back of the White
Lion Inn, North Street.&nbsp; A little society was formed in
consequence, and after a time there was a growing anxiety for a
place wherein they might hold their meetings.&nbsp; The Countess
would have been glad to have provided a house of meeting, but at
that time her funds were exhausted, she having already given some
hundred thousand pounds to the cause of God.&nbsp; She, however,
devised a plan for raising the necessary means; she sent for her
jeweller, opened her casket of jewels, and disposed of them, the
following account of which cannot fail to interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>Her Ladyship at that time lived in a house which formed a part
of North street,&mdash;the business of the town then being
transacted in the Lanes,&mdash;and built a little Chapel with
these funds at the back of her private house, on the site of the
present chapel, which was opened in the Autumn of 1761, the Rev.
Matthew Madden preaching the opening sermon.&nbsp; It had only
been opened six years when it was found to be too small for its
congregation, and, in February, 1767, it was enlarged and
re-opened by the Rev. M. Madden and the Rev. G. Whitefield.&nbsp;
In 1774 it was taken down and rebuilt, this time at the expense
of Miss Norton, a friend of the Countess, who lived in an
adjoining house.&nbsp; In 1775 it was re-opened, for the third
time, by the Rev. W. Romaine, the then Rector of St. Ann&rsquo;s,
Blackfriars.&nbsp; In 1810, a further enlargement was found to be
necessary, and it was then made capable of accommodating 1,000
persons. <a name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a>&nbsp; In 1821 another considerable
enlargement took place, <a name="page366"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 366</span>making it capable of holding 1,500
persons.&nbsp; It was again enlarged in 1842,&mdash;when the
chapel-house was thrown into the body of the place,&mdash;to its
present condition.</p>
<p>Among the celebrated Ministers who have preached there,
besides those already mentioned, may be named, Revs. A. M.
Toplady, Berridge, Jones, Fletcher, Henry Venn, Dr.
Rawes,&mdash;the founder of the London Missionary
Society,&mdash;and the late lamented Pastor, the Rev. Joseph
Sortain.&nbsp; The Rev. J. B. Figgis is the present Pastor.</p>
<p>Union Street Chapel was erected, after the repeal of the
Non-Conformist Act, in 1698, and for upwards of one hundred years
continued in the hands of the Presbyterians.&nbsp; It now belongs
to a congregation of Dissenters of the Independent
denomination.&nbsp; In 1810 it was considerably enlarged, under
the Pastorate of the Rev. Dr. Styles.&nbsp; In 1823, the Rev. J.
N. Goulty, at the earnest request of the congregation, accepted
the Pastorate.&nbsp; At that time there was a debt of
&pound;1,000 on the Chapel, only about half of which had been
provided for before he took the office.&nbsp; The attendance so
increased, especially at evening services, that it was found
desirable, in the Summer of 1825, to have it taken down and
entirely re-built.&nbsp; The expenses of this alteration were
immediately subscribed by the congregation, except about
&pound;500, which was lent upon debentures, to be taken up in
five years, which were ultimately satisfactorily settled.&nbsp;
It is now capable of seating nearly 1,000 persons.&nbsp; In
January, 1862, after 38 years&rsquo; indefatigable labour, the
Rev. J. N. Goulty resigned the Pastorate, and was succeeded by
the Rev. R. Vaughan Pryce, M.A., LL.B.</p>
<p>Trinity Chapel is situated in Ship Street, and was built in
1817, by Messrs. Wilds, at the sole expense of Thomas Read Kemp,
Esq., M.P., who officiated personally until 1825, when it was
purchased by the Rev. Robert Anderson.&nbsp; It has undergone
several alterations, and is at present used as a Chapel of Ease
to the Church of England.&nbsp; The interior is extremely
handsome.&nbsp; In the centre of the ceiling rises a small dome,
partly covered with glass, which adds to the light, and gives a
free ventilation of air.&nbsp; The Rev. Henry Herbert Wyatt,
M.A., is the present Incumbent.</p>
<p>Wesleyan Chapel, Dorset Gardens, was erected in 1808, and <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>is capable
of accommodating 700 persons.&nbsp; There is no settled Pastor to
the congregation, but it is supplied with ministers appointed by
the Conference.&nbsp; In connexion with this Chapel are the
Windsor Street and Upper Bedford Street (Zion) Wesleyan
Chapels.</p>
<p>St. James&rsquo;s Chapel, on the north side of St.
James&rsquo;s Street, was built in 1810.&nbsp; The Duke of
Marlborough, on being apprized that the scheme for the erection
of this Chapel was on foot, and that the expences attending it
would be covered by voluntary contributions, with that liberality
which so distinguished him during his residence in Grove House,
instantly subscribed &pound;100, and expressed a hope, on doing
so, that&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;&ldquo;the playhouse
method of receiving shillings for admission, as at the Chapel
Royal, would not be adopted when the building was
completed.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Lordship&rsquo;s hopes were fully
realized, and the Chapel, being built by shares, was called a
Free Chapel.&nbsp; Some few years after its erection, in
consequence of the congregation dissenting from the Established
Church, it was taken by the late Nathaniel Kemp, Esq., of
Ovingdean, who purchased all the shares, became sole-proprietor,
and had it duly consecrated.&nbsp; The property has now passed
into the hands of his widow and children.&nbsp; The Rev. C. D.
Maitland, the present Incumbent, was nominated in February,
1828.&nbsp; In 1836 the school-room was built adjoining the
Chapel, wherein about 250 children of both sexes have been
religiously instructed every Sunday since that time, and 130
girls have been daily receiving an useful education.</p>
<p>St. Margaret&rsquo;s Chapel is situated in St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Place, on the west side of Cannon Place.&nbsp;
It was built, in 1825, as a Chapel of Ease.&nbsp; This Chapel is
&ldquo;proprietary,&rdquo; though consecrated under special Act
of Parliament.&nbsp; The Rev. Edmund Clay, B.A., who was
appointed in February, 1856, pays a rental of &pound;375 per
annum, and all expenses of repairs and others incidental to the
due performance of Divine Worship: averaging over &pound;200 per
annum.&nbsp; In connexion with this Chapel are the Industrial
Girls&rsquo; School, built by the Rev. E. Clay, in 1856, at a
cost of &pound;1,600; the Youths&rsquo; Evening School, in Cannon
Street, and an Infant Nursery, in Regency Square.</p>
<p>St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, built, in 1825, under a special Act
of Parliament, in St. George&rsquo;s Road, and directly opposite
the <a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>Hospital, at the sole expense of Thomas Read Kemp,
Esq., is capable of holding about 1,200 people.&nbsp; The Rev. J.
S. M. Anderson, Chaplain to the Queen and Queen Dowager,
officiated for a number of years, and was very popular.&nbsp; He
was succeeded by the present Incumbent, the Rev. J. H. North,
M.A.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel, St. James&rsquo;s Street, was erected
in 1827.&nbsp; This Chapel is built after a model of the Temple
of Nemesis, at Athens.&nbsp; Incumbent and Patron, Rev. H. V.
Elliott, M.A.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s (the Evangelist) Chapel, Carlton Hill, was
built in 1840, by Messrs. Cheesman, upon a site most
unfortunately selected, and without any architectural
advice.&nbsp; There are four Schools in connexion with this
Chapel, under the clerical management of the Perpetual Curate,
upon the principles of self-support, which are calculated to
exercise a powerful influence for good in this, the very poorest
portion of the town, the building being made over for ever to the
National Society for the Education of the Poor in the principles
of the Established Church, and placed under trust of the
Archdeacon of Lewes.&nbsp; Rev. A. A. Morgan, M.A., is the
present Incumbent.</p>
<p>Christ Church, Montpelier Road, was consecrated on 26th April,
1838, and built by Mr. G. Cheesman.&nbsp; There was no public
laying of the foundation stone.&nbsp; It is capable of holding
about 1,200 people, 700 of the sittings being free.&nbsp; The
Rev. James Vaughan, M.A., has been Incumbent from the
opening.&nbsp; Adjoining this Church, in Bedford Place, are
Educational Schools for middle classes, erected, in 1843, by
Messrs. Wisden and Anscombe.&nbsp; Besides these there is an
Infant School, connected with the Church, in Clarence
Gardens.</p>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, West Street, is a large and handsome
building, built, in 1848, by Messrs. Cheesman, from a design by
Mr. Carpenter, architect.&nbsp; It is built of cut flints with
stone coignes, and is intended to be finished with a lofty
spire.&nbsp; It is in the decorated English style.&nbsp; The
Church is entered by a covered way or cloister.&nbsp; The
interior is highly decorated in the medi&aelig;val style.&nbsp;
The roof of the nave is of timber, and that of the chancel is
painted blue with gold stars; several of the windows are of
stained glass.&nbsp; It contains a nave, north and south aisles,
and chancel, and <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>has a fine toned organ; a peal of bells, the largest in
the town, have been hung in the unfinished tower.&nbsp; It was
consecrated on St. Luke&rsquo;s Day, 1849.&nbsp; The Rev. A. D.
Wagner is the Incumbent.</p>
<p>Hanover Chapel, situated at the top of Church Street, in the
rear of the Odd Fellows&rsquo; Hall, was opened for public
worship on the 30th of August, 1825, and belongs to the
Presbyterian denomination.&nbsp; It was erected at the sole
expense (&pound;4,000) of the Rev. M. Edwards, of Petworth, who,
with the assistance of some of the most popular preachers of the
day, also supplied its pulpit.&nbsp; It is calculated to seat
1,200 persons.</p>
<p>Salem Chapel, Bond Street, was erected in 1787; was enlarged
in 1825, and rebuilt in 1861.&nbsp; It is now a very handsome
building, belonging to the Particular Baptists.&nbsp; The Rev.
George Isaacs is Minister.</p>
<p>All Saints&rsquo; Church, Clifton Road, is a fine specimen of
early English architecture.&nbsp; It was built in 1852 by Messrs.
Cheesman.&nbsp; It has a nave, side aisles, and chancel, and
contains a fine toned organ.&nbsp; Its spire remains as yet
unfinished.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Coombe, B.A., is Incumbent and
Surrogate.</p>
<p>All Souls&rsquo; Church, in Eastern Road, was erected by
subscription in 1833, by Messrs. Mew, for the accommodation of
the poor and working classes; the seats are nearly all
free.&nbsp; The benefice is a Perpetual Curacy.&nbsp; The Rev.
Richard Snowden Smith, M.A., is Incumbent.</p>
<p>St. Andrew&rsquo;s Chapel, Waterloo Street, in the parish of
Hove, is a neat building, and contains several handsome marble
tablets.&nbsp; It was completed in 1828, and will contain 600
people.&nbsp; The Rev. W. H. Rooper is the present Patron and
Incumbent, assisted by the Right Rev. Bishop Trower.</p>
<p>Providence Chapel, Church Street, is of the Calvanistic
persuasion, and was built in 1805.&nbsp; Minister, Rev. Thomas
Bayfield.&nbsp; The other Calvanistic Chapel in Brighton (Jireh
Chapel) is in Robert Street, Glo&rsquo;ster Lane, of which the
Rev. Thomas Dray is the Minister.</p>
<p>Ebenezer Chapel, Richmond Street, was the second Place of
Worship erected in Brighton for the Particular Baptists.&nbsp; It
was opened in 1825.&nbsp; Rev. Israel Atkinson, Minister.</p>

other Baptist Chapels in the town are Queen&rsquo;s
Square&mdash;Rev. Joseph Wilkins; Tabernacle Chapel, West
Street&mdash;Rev. John Grace; Bethsaida Hall Chapel, Windsor
Street&mdash;Rev. Thomas Stringer.</p>
<p>St. James&rsquo;s Church, Cambridge Road, is a noble edifice,
of Kentish rag and Bath stone, in the early decorative English
style.&nbsp; It has a lofty nave, chancel, two aisles, and
chapels, and for external beauty is one of the most imposing
churches in Brighton.&nbsp; It was erected in 1858, at the sole
expense of the Rev. Thomas O&rsquo;Brien, D.D., who is now Patron
and Incumbent.</p>
<p>Christ Church, New Road, originally known as the Unitarian
Chapel, was built from a design of Mr. Wilds.&nbsp; It has a
light and elegant fluted Doric portico, and is built after the
style of the Temple of Theseus.&nbsp; Since the appointment of
the Rev. Robert Ainslie great improvements have been made in the
interior arrangements, and the comfort of the congregation
thereby much enhanced.</p>
<p>There are three Roman Catholic Chapels in Brighton: St. John
the Baptist&rsquo;s, Bristol Road; St. Mary Magdalene, 51, Upper
North Street; and West Cliff Catholic Chapel, Sillwood
Lodge.&nbsp; The first chapel of this denomination was in High
Street.&nbsp; In 1833, the number of Roman Catholic visitors
increased so rapidly that it was deemed expedient to build a
larger one, and in 1837, St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s was opened,
and the one in High Street abandoned.&nbsp; The old Chapel is now
used as a printing office, by Mrs. Sickelmore.&nbsp; The interior
of the Chapel in Bristol Road is very airy, and commodious, but
its external appearance is heavy, the Corinthian pilasters being
disproportionately large.&nbsp; The officiating Priests there at
the present time are the Very Rev. Canon Reardon, the Very Rev.
Canon Rymer, and the Rev. William Stone.&nbsp; St.
Mary-Magdalene&rsquo;s was erected in 1861&ndash;2, by Messrs.
Cheesman, from a design by Mr. Rodley, and opened in February,

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XXXI.<br />
HOVE AND CLIFTONVILLE.</h2>
<p>Adjoining Brighton on the west, is the parish of Hove, which
still retains nearly its ancient name, being written in the
Doomsday Book <i>Hov</i>.&nbsp; It covers a large area of ground,
and, for the most part, is laid out in fine open streets, and
houses of noble elevation.&nbsp; Palmeira Square and Adelaide
Crescent, projected by the late Baron Goldsmid, and now
completed, is the most magnificent range of buildings in the
parish.&nbsp; In 1801, the population of Hove was only 101, in
1811 it increased to 312, and in 1831 to 1,360, in 1851 to 4,104,
in 1861 to 9,818.&nbsp; This great increase in population during
the last ten years is to be attributed to the building of
Cliftonville, forming quite a new town in the centre of the
parish.&nbsp; The houses generally are semi-detached villas and
private residences, many of which display much architectural
beauty.&nbsp; The parish church (St. Peter) is a flint and stone
building in the Norman style, and was restored in 1834 from the
ruins of one which was formerly considered a structure of great
beauty and grandeur, the tower of <a name="page372"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 372</span>which fell down in 1801.&nbsp; After
the falling of the tower, a wooden pigeon-house steeple was
erected, and the centre aisle sufficiently accommodated the
congregation up to the time of its restoration.&nbsp; The
accommodation afforded by Hove parish church, owing to the rapid
rise of Cliftonville, was soon found to be inadequate to the
requirements of the community,&mdash;as in certain seasons of the
year the influx of visitors is so great that the population is
considered not less than 12,000; and in 1852, another church was
erected at the west end of the Western Road, and dedicated to St.
John the Baptist, and even now the church accommodation is
insufficient.&nbsp; In 1855 a Town Hall was built by the
Commissioners.&nbsp; This was necessitated in consequence of
Brighton having obtained a Charter of Incorporation, and
consequently criminal cases arising in Hove and villages in its
neighbourhood could no longer be adjudicated on by the Brighton
Bench.&nbsp; The County Magistrates are C. Carpenter, Esq., John
Borrer, Esq., W. Furner, Esq., R. Henty, Esq., Colonel Paine, M.
D. Scott, Esq., F. S. Hurlock, Esq., J. H. Pickford, Esq., W. F.
Smithe, Esq., Sir G. A. Westphal, and P. Salomons, Esq.&nbsp; The
police force is very effective, there being one constable to
every 500 inhabitants.&nbsp; The fire brigade is made up from the
police force, and is organised under the direction of
Superintendent Breach.&nbsp; Building operations still continue
in Hove to a large extent, a new road (Cambridge Road) being just
completed, and a new street having recently been laid out to the
west of the Sussex Hotel, in Cliftonville.&nbsp; The houses there
are being built by Mr. Jabez Reynolds, of Brighton, on a large
scale, and bids fair to form one of the finest streets in the
parish.</p>

extensive vale that occupies the centre of the south-eastern part
of the county, and, running parallel with the Downs, forms their
northern boundary.&nbsp; It was anciently an immense forest

retreat for deer and swine: the greater part is now in an
excellent state of cultivation.&nbsp; It consists of various beds
of clay, sand, and limestone, and is comparatively of low

death of, we believe, the oldest inhabitant of Brighton, Mrs.
Ackerson, who had reached her 97th year.&nbsp; She was the widow
of the late Mr. Robert Ackerson, who filled the offices of High
Constable, Overseer, Churchwarden, and Parish Assessor of
Brighton.&nbsp; When Royalty smiled on this little fishing
village, the not least important of the Brighton fair was the
wife of Bob Ackerson, whose merits were prominently blazoned by
one who loved the comforts of the world,&mdash;no less a
personage than Johnny Townshend, the celebrated Bow-street
runner, who lived, during the residence of the Prince in
Brighton, with the old Brightonian, at the corner of Duke Street,
West Street, where Royalty itself was wont to take a
luncheon.&nbsp; Cribbage was ever a favourite game with her, and
till within a few months of her death her knowledge and play were
as acute as ever.&nbsp; She read much: the Bible, the Book of
Common Prayer, and the Sermons of the Rev. J. S. M. Anderson
being her universal favourites.&nbsp; It is worthy of record that
she was a twin, the other infant, a boy, surviving but a few
hours.&nbsp; She was childless; yet many an orphan will long
revere her memory.&nbsp; Nearly up to the close of her long life
Mrs. Ackerson was in possession of her faculties; her hearing was
not greatly impaired; her eye-sight was what would be considered,
for persons many years her junior, good; and her recollection was
astonishing.&nbsp; She delighted to hold converse with persons
who taxed her memory, and would relate the reminiscences of her
youthful days with much glee.&nbsp; She loved to talk of her old
associations in the early years of George IV.; and would do so
with all the freshness of a person in the prime of life.&nbsp;
She was a remarkably fine woman, and her carriage was almost as
erect just before she died as it had ever been.&nbsp; Perhaps so
noble and firm a pattern of old age has scarcely been
witnessed.&nbsp; During the last few years of her life she had
resided with her nephew, Mr. J. A. Erredge, on the London Road,
to whose family she was much attached.&nbsp; We understand that
she retained her recollection and composure to the last, and died
most tranquilly.&mdash;<i>Brighton Herald</i>, Feb. 10th,

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
